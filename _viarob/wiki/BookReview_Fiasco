@h1 BookReview: Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq
@div.bib by Thomas E. Ricks, Penguin Press, July 25, 2006, 159420103X

Ricks does a great job summarizing the policy blunders in the
U.S. (mis)adventure in Iraq.  From Bremer's micro-management to
Wolfowitz's incomprehension of the facts.  It's all there, and covered
in detail with lots of quotes.  Indeed, there were so many interesting
quotes, I would have to have quoted them all here, and I don't have
that much time. :-(
