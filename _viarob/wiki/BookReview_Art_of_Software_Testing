@h1 BookReview: Art of Software Testing
@div.bib by Glenford Myers, John Wiley & Sons, 1979
 This small book is one of the classics on software testing.
Myers covers boundary-values, equivalence classes, and how to test in
general.  The technical aspects of testing are still relevant.  The
process methodology is outdated.

@blockquote
[p36] What subset of all possible test cases has the highest probability of
detecting the most errors?

@blockquote
[p50] It is difficult to present a "cookbook" for boundary-value
analysis, since it requires a degree of creativiy and a certain amount
of specialization toward the problem at hand.

@blockquote
[p56] It has a beneficial side effect in pointing out incompleteness
and ambiguities in the specification.
