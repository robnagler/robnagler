@h1 BookReview: Freeing Our Families from Perfectionism
@div.bib by Thomas S. Greenspon, PhD, Free Spirit Publishing Inc., 2002, 1-57542-103-8
 Greenspon writes well, and explains what perfectionism is and its
root causes.  Perfectionism is not the way to success, and indeed it
often blocks success.  Criticism is non-acceptance, and encouragement
sets up the positive feedback loop we need to help our children (and
ourselves) grow.   Apology and letting go are the keys to ending power
struggles.
