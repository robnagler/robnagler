[p176] Essay by Edmond H. Weiss, Usability: Stereotypes and Traps [...]
First, testing a manual only after it is a complete draft is much
too late in the life of the publication.  By the time a book has
reached the draft, its most serious failings are deeply
ingrained--``wired in.''  It is much too late, and probably much too
expensive, to correct them.

Second, testing the pieces or ``modules'' of a larger publication
does little to assuer the usability of the publications as a whole.
In just the way that succesful ``unit tests'' of a computer program
do not betoken an installed, functional system, neither do succesful
tests of the parts of a manual prove that the book will be usable.

@blockquote
If we pursue usability as thought it were an abstract, technical
imperative, then we confuse usability with perfection--the same
mistake many quality enthusiasts make.  Because there cannot be a
``perfectly usable manual,'' we soon see that what is really meant by
a usable manual is one usable eenought to meet our business or
management objectives. And a while later, when costs become an issue,
usable enough to please readers and customers we most wish to please.

 "The On-line Environment and In-House Training" by Barrett and
Paradis, is a good article.
