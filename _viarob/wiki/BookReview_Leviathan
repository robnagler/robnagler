@h1 BookReview: Leviathan
@div.bib by Paul Auster, Penguin Books, 1992, 0-14-017813-9
 The book is written in the first person by an author (Peter Aaron) about
his friend Benjamin Sachs.  Aaron walks through his life after Sach's death.
Auster is a genius at creating characters and being true to them.

[p40] No one can say where a book comes from, least of all the person
who writes it.  Books are born out of ignorance, and if they go on
living after they are written, it's only to the degree that they
cannot be understood.
