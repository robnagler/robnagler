@h1 BookReview: The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason
@div.bib by Sam Harris, Norton, 2004, 0-39303515-8

Develops evidence that moderation in religion gives way to
extremism.  If we deny the existence of the supernatural, we give no
room for extremism.  Islam is worse than Western culture, because it
promotes the death of infidels, much as Christianity does.  However,
Islam still implements its edicts (honor killings).  Last chapters
lost me.  Especially on torture so I wrote him this note:

Sam,

Thanks for the incredibly deep and rich book.  Possibly the most
eye-opening question for me was: Can we say that Middle Eastern men
who are murderously obsessed with female sexual purity actually love
their wives, daughters, and sisters *less* than American or European
men do?  The book made me think differently, thanks.

I was, however, disappointed by your treatment of torture.  To me, the
use of force -- physical or mental -- is an ethical question that must
be resolved within the context.  There are two questions: is force
ethical and what force should I apply?

In war, force is generally ethical.  However, this is predicated on
the fact that the war itself is ethical.  Some simple "facts" about
our intention to go to war in Iraq have yet to be proven true.  This
puts into question whether the U.S. Government's choice to use force
was ethical.  Unlike your news anchorman on p. 94 (who works for Fox
or NPR, btw?), the U.S. Government's credibility depends on its
ability to prove its accusations.  It hasn't, and as such, makes the
entire case for the use of force in Iraq, and thusly Guantanamo, built
on shifting sands.

You furthermore make some interesting leaps of faith in the following
statement: "There, after all, no *infants* interned at Guantanamo Bay,
just rather scrofulous young men, many of whom were caught in the very
act of trying to kill our soldiers."  We actually don't know who they
are holding in Guantanamo.  What is missing is that these folks (male
or female, young or old?) were captured in foreign countries, which we
attacked, and none of those countries citizens had actually attacked
ours; it was 19 Saudis who killed 3,000 people on our soil.  One could
argue those folks had an ethical right to defend their country.  If
someone walks into your house with a gun, do you have the ethical
right to attack first?  Yes.  Furthermore, we haven't even bothered to
take Osama Bin Laden to court in absentia.

My doubts are not that Islam is a violent religion, or that we have
forced terrorism on us.  Rather, we have failed to prove the case for
the use of force, and thusly torture.

Leaving the yes/no question aside.  How much force should we apply?
Torture is but one means to an end.  Deception is another -- as your
escapade in Prague suggests.  The question of the ticking time bomb is
posed too narrowly.  We can use deception and other forceful means of
extracting information from the unwilling, including *simulating*
torture of the unwilling's family.  I would argue that simulating
physical torture is better than actually inflicting it.

When someone attacks you, you feel anger.  Torture is as much a means
to extract information as it is a way to extract vengeance.  Capital
punishment is a form of legalized torture in the U.S.  It is
implemented after the information is extracted, and its victim has
been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  It's primary purpose is
for vengeance.  The U.S. military in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cuba, and ???
are not above anger, and likely have been using torture as a means of
vengeance.

Finally, there is a relativist dimension to force.  It comes down to
"Lord of the Flies" ethics, if you will.  If you use force, you bet
others will against you.  Moreover, if you use force on an innocent,
you may have created an enemy, a new convert to the faith of hate.
That may be strategically inept.  For if you do use force on an
innocent, and you indeed find out he is innocent.  You must let them
go -- in my ethics.  If the force has made them psychotic -- an
unfortunate and unpredictable side-effect of torture -- and that
person clever and resourceful, you may end up creating an even bigger
disaster on your hands.

If you analyze the situation in Iraq, you may find that this is
precisely what has happened.  Many otherwise peaceful and innocent and
non-extremist Muslims are now taking up arms.  This is not an ethical
problem, but a strategic one caused by extremely poor tactics.  Force
is a tactic, not a strategy, and the U.S. Government seems not to have
a strategy at all in its recent wars.

One last comment on your comment on a cold war with Islam.  Pakistan
has nuclear weapons and is Muslim and is in a cold war with India.
One distinguishing feature of Islamic leadership is a strong sense of
self-preservation as Al Sadr -- among others -- has clearly
demonstrated.  They don't "eat their own dog food" as much as you
think they do.

Again, thanks for a book that changed the way I think about things.

Cheers,
Rob Nagler

@blockquote
[p128] It should be of particular concern to us that the beliefs of
Muslims pose a special problem for nuclear deterrence.  There is
little possibility of our having a _cold_ war with an Islamist
regime armed with long-range nuclear weapons.  A cold war requires
that the parties be mutually deterred by the threat of death.  Notions
of martydom and jihad run roughshod over the logic that allowed the
United States and the Soviet Union to pass half a centure perched,
more or less stably, on the brink of Armageddon.  What will we do if
an Islamist regime, which grows dewy-eyed at the mere mention of
paradis, ever acquires long-range nuclear weaponry? [Why hasn't
Pakistan used the weapons?  It's because those in power don't actually
believe what the preach.  That's an important data point.]

@blockquote
[p155] One wonder whether [Roy] Moore, [John] Ashcroft, the
U.S. Congress, and three-quarters of the American people would like to
see the _punishments_ for breaking these hallowed commandments
also specfied in marble and placed in our nation's courts.  What,
after all, is the punishment for taking the Lord's name in vain?  It
happens to be death (Leviticus 24:16).  What is the punishment for
working on the Sabbath? Also death (Exodus 31:15).

@blockquote
[p176] When was the last time that someone was criticized for not
"respecting' another person's unfounded beliefs about physics or
history?  The same rules should apply to ethical, spritual, and
religious beliefs as well. Credit goes to Christopher Hitchens for
distilling, in a single phrase, a principle of discourse that could
well arrest our slide toward the abyss: "what can be asserted without
evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."  Let us pray that
billions agree with him.

@blockquote
[p182] Respect for _diversity_ in our ethical views is, at best,
an intellectual holding pattern until more of the facts are in.

@blockquote
[p188] Augustine, for instance, when considering the moral stature of
virgins who had been raped by the Goths, wondered whether they had not
been "unduly puffed up by [their] integrity, continence and chastity."
Perhaps they suffered "some lurking infirmity which might have
betrayed them into proud and contemptuous bearing, ahad they not been
subjectoed to the humiliation that befell them."
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[p189] Can we say that Middle Eastern men who are murderously obsessed
with female sexual purity actually love their wives, daughters, and
sisters _less_ than American or European men do?  Of course, we
can.  And what is truly incredible about the state of our discourse is
that such a claim is not only controversial but actually
_unutterable_ in most contexts.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[p194] Rather, it seems obvious that the misapplication of toture
should be far _less_ troubling to us than collateral damage:
there, after all, no _infants_ interned at Guantanamo Bay, just
rather scrofulous young men, many of whom were caught in the very act
of trying to kill our soldiers.

[p244] 12. Compare much of what Jesus taught with the above quotation
from John 15:6, or with Matt. 10:34--"Think not that I am come to send
peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword."  For a
remarkably elegant demonstration of the incoherency of the Bible, I
recommend Burr's _Self-contradictions_of_the_Bible_ (1860).

@blockquote
[p249] 51. [...] Consider the statement of the Roman Catholic primate
of Poland, August Cardinal Hlond, in a 1936 pastoral letter: "There
will be the Jewish problem as long as the Jews remain.  It is a fact
that the Jews are fighting against the Catholic Church, persisting in
free thinking, and are the vanguard of godlessness, Bolshevism, and
subersion ...  It is a fact that the Jews deceive, levey interest, and
re pimps.  It is a fact that the religious and ethical influence of
the Jewish young people on the Polish young people is a negative one."

@blockquote
[p275] 31.[...] To assert that there should be no "experts" in morals
-- as both Kantians and anti-Kantians tend to do -- is, on my account,
rather like saying that there should be no experts in chess, perhaps
adducing as one's evidence that every party to our discouse can
plainly see how to move the pieces.  We need no experts to tell us how
the matter stands; nor do we need experts to tell us that cruelty is
wrong.  But we do need experts to tell us what the best move is from
any given position; and there is little doubt that we will need
experts to tell us that loving all people, without distinction, makes
one happier than feeling preferential love for one's intimates (if
this is indeed the case).
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[p276] 34. [...] There is a difference, after all, between intending
to inflict suffering on an innocent person and inflicting it by
accident.  To include a suspect terrorist's family among the
instruments of torture would be a flagrant violation of this principle.
