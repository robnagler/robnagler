@h1 BookReview: First Off the Tee: Presidential Hackers, Duffers, and Cheaters From Taft To Bush 
@div.bib by Don Van Natta Jr., Perseus Books Group, October 30, 2004, 1586482653

Don Van Natta is a weekend "hacker" who wrote an article attacking
Clinton's veracity on the golf course.  He ended up play a round with
Clinton, and having a degree of respect for him, despite him taking
"Billigans", which are not "Mulligans" (cheats) or "Gimmes" (putts
assumed, instead of taken).

The book covers all the golfing presidents up to #43, George
W. Bush.   The prose is excellent, and the annecdotes are wonderful.
Kennedy was the best, LBJ was the worst, and simply didn't care.  Golf
and politics mix constantly in the book.  It's an enjoyable read that
will teach you something unique about all the presidents.

[p311] As IT TURNS OUT, golf is fatal only to the presidential
aspirants who dare not play it.

The list of recent Presidential nominees who are nongolfers is a
losers' roll: AI Gore, Bob Dole, Michael Dukakis, and Walter
Mondale. None of those men played the game, and all four were defeated
in presidential elections by candidates whose affection for the game
was well known to the electorate.

After all, it is impossible to imagine Al Gore yelling "Fore!" off the
tee or soaking up an eighteen-hole lesson from Greg Norman. Michael
Dukakis would look as ridiculous piloting a golf cart as he looked at
the helm of an army tank wearing that oversized helmet. Can you
imagine Walter Mondale laughing gleefully as he sneaked away for
eighteen holes in the middle of a workday afternoon?

@blockquote
But you can envision George H. W Bush and George W Bush needling each
other as they catapult the cart through a two-hour round of
eighteen.  You can hear Ronald Reagan joking about melting his metal
iron shafts into an ashtray. And it is easy to see Clinton [p312]
writing a "4" on his scorecard after shooting a "6." On the golf
course, these presidents have acted the way we have come to expect
them to act.

@blockquote
The golfing presidents are guys you can imagine relaxing with after
playing a round. Over a few beers, it is easy to imagine replaying
that awful hole with Taft or Harding or Ike or Ford.

@blockquote
In life and in politics, there are golfers and there are
nongolfers. The American people have spoken: We prefer
golfers.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
Granted, this amounts to absurd political analysis, but it is hard to
argue with these facts: In the past century, Jimmy Carter was the only
nongolfer to defeat a golfer, Gerald Ford, on Election Day. Ford's
pardon of another golfer, Nixon, did him in, though another golfer,
Ronald Reagan, made sure that Carter served a single term. In fact,
the three nongolfing chief executives in the past centuryHerbert
Hoover, Harry S Truman, and Jimmy Carter-were all elected to single
terms in office.

@blockquote
What does this phenomenon say about the state of the game and the
state of presidential politics?

@blockquote
If you are a potential president, it is wise to play golf and wiser
still to publicly embrace that passion. (William Howard Taft was
exactly right, after all.) But be warned: Do not play too well. Dan
Quayle was the most talented golfer to serve in the executive branch,
but his single-digit handicap became a national punch line. If an
elected official can make Nicklaus or Norman sweat, Americans will
assume that he is spending too much time golfing and not enough time
governing.

@blockquote
We want presidents who playas poorly and recklessly as we do. We would
even prefer a golf cheat to a scratch golfer.
