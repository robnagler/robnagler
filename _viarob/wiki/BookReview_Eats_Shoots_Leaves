@h1 BookReview: Eats, Shoots & Leaves
@div.bib by Lynne Truss, Gotham Brooks, 2003, 1-592-40087-6
 A hilariously funny book about punctuation.  Truss is a
great writer with a penchant for details.  She makes an normally
boring topic into a very interesting and even exciting read.

[p202] Proper punctuation is both the sign and the cause of clear thinking.
If it goes, the degree of intellectual impoverishment we face is unimaginable.
