@h1 BookReview: The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited
@div.bib by Benny Morris, Cambridge University Press;, 1/5/2004, 978-0521009676

This classic text was revised without a thematic change.  Other
books have come out which shed light on Plan Dalet, which is arguably
the cause of the Palestinian Refugee problem.  It's a thick book, but
it fails to convince.  The conclusion is a fiat, not proven thesis:

@blockquote
[p588] The first Arab-Israeli war, of 1948, was launched by the
Palestinian Arabs, who rejected the UN partition resolution and
embarked on hostilities aimed at the preventing the birth of Israel.
That war and not design, Jewish or Arab, gave birth to the Palestinian
refugee problem.
