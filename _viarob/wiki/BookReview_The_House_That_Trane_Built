@h1 BookReview: The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse Records
@div.bib by Ashley Kahn, W. W. Norton, June 6, 2006, 978-0393058796

Kahn is a Coltrane expert and fills this book with lots of insider
facts and interviews about Impulse Records.  Coltrane was a visionary
musician, and he was given free reign at Impulse.  Here's a quote from
Yusef Lateef:

[p116] "I was free to record what I chose to: that was a strong point
to me. When you give a person, freedom they give you their utmost.  I
think Bob Thiele realized that."
