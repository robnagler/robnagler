@h1 BookReview: A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention, and the Four Theatres of the Brain
@div.bib by John J. Ratey, Vintage, January 8, 2002, 978-0375701078

This has to be the best book I've read on the brain, ever.  John
Ratey explains in layman's terms the latest research on the brain and
are behavior comes directly from the brain's biology.

The Four Theatres is a model for "analyzing human experience".  This
is not a literal framework, but a way of thinking about patients'
brains.  The four theaters are "perception captures incoming stimuli;
attention, consciousness, and cognition filter and process these
perceptions; the brain functions then work with this information and
affect how subsequent information is perceived and processed; the
final result is behavior and, ultimately, identity."

The Four Theatres aside, the book explains the brain as we understand
it today in great detail.  While you may not agree with his model,
you'll get an education on how the brain metabolizes stimuli (my
words).

[k143] The accepted wisdom has always been that the key to success in
life is to know yourself, and this still remains one of the most basic
truths of philosophy, psychology, and religion. To know ourselves, we
must become good self-observers, and it is for this reason, more than
any other, that we must learn about the object that drives our logic,
imagination, and passion. Biological determinism,

@blockquote
[k163] It's not surprising that language about the brain is complex,
for the brain is the most complex object in the universe. There are a
hundred billion neurons in a single human brain, and roughly ten times
as many other cells that have noncomputational roles.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k190] The brain is so complex, and so plastic, that it is virtually
impossible, except in the broadest fashion, to predict how a given
factor will influence its state.

[k194] Darwinism." These networks of synapses, Edelman argues, are
more than a vast communicative infrastructure; each network in the
brain is striving against the others for feedback from the outside
world.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k224] Likewise, blaming yourself for the physiological shortcomings
of your brain, whatever they may be, is misdirected energy, energy
better spent in changing your habits and lifestyle to live the most
productive life you can.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k355] Brain structure is not predetermined and fixed. We can alter
the ongoing development of our brains and thus our capabilities. This
is not always beneficial, however, as sometimes in the brain's attempt
to adapt, the rewiring can make things worse.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k384] The first weeks and months are a time of furious cell
production and overproduction, with 250,000 neuroblasts, or primitive
nerve cells, being created every minute.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k405] The two main types of cells, neurons and glia, make up the
brain, which is pretty much complete by the eighth month of
pregnancy. At this point there are twice as many neurons as in the
adult brain. As the brain ages,
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k430] A period of cell death during the later stages of pregnancy
wipes out almost half the neurons in the brain, which are probably
phagocytized, or eaten up, by the support cells of the brain and the
molecules recycled locally. There is a drop from about 200 billion
neurons to 100 billion. This widespread cell death is normal, for it
eliminates the wrong and weak connections that could inhibit efficient
and proper brain function. This is a classic example of the incredible
resourcefulness of evolution, which makes us highly adaptable
creatures. It also points to the fact that even at the very beginning
of development the brain is a social organ: where there is no
connection, there is no life.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k519] "Neurons that fire together wire together" means that the more
we repeat the same actions and thoughts--from practicing a tennis
serve to memorizing multiplication tables--the more we encourage the
formation of certain connections and the more fixed the neural
circuits in the brain for that activity become. "Use it or lose it" is
the corollary: if you don't exercise brain circuits, the connections
will not be adaptive and will slowly weaken and could be lost.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k538] A mere 50,000 genes for the brain are not nearly enough to
account for the 100 trillion synaptic connections that are made
there. Genes set boundaries for human behavior, but within these
boundaries there is immense room for variation determined by
experience, personal choice, and even chance.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k555] Studies of identical twins separated at birth are often used to
test the debate between nature and nurture. While these can be
valuable, this test is hamstrung from the start for several reasons,
one of which is that differences in the position of each twin in
relation to the placenta may bring with them differences in blood
supply, hormonal levels, and other factors that are not intrinsic to
the genes of the twins. Whether a twin is a "front child" or a "back
child," a "spleen child" or a "liver child," makes a difference.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k578] Genes and the environment work together to shape our brains,
and we can manage them both if we want to. It may be harder for people
with certain genes or surroundings, but "harder" is a long way from
predetermination.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
LEARNING TO CHANGE THE NEURAL PATHWAYS that control the basic
functions we need to survive--heartbeat, temperature control,
breathing--are already connected at birth, but many more pathways are
determined by the greatest environmental factor in our lives:
learning. Although the brain's flexibility may decrease with age, it
remains plastic throughout life, restructuring itself according to
what it learns. The brains of children three to ten years old consume
twice as much of the blood nutrient glucose as those of adults, in
part because their brains are less efficient and are in the business
of forming a vast number of connections. Studies also show that
children who exercise regularly do better in school. New research
indicates that adult exercise juices the brain with more glucose too,
which may promote an increase in neural connections.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k606] The drug Prozac can be helpful in breaking these kinds of
deadlocks. We always have the ability to remodel our brains. To change
the wiring in one skill, you must engage in some activity that is
unfamiliar, novel to you but related to that skill, because simply
repeating the same activity only maintains already established
connections. To bolster his creative circuitry, Albert Einstein played
the violin. Winston Churchill painted landscapes. You can try puzzles
to strengthen connections involved with spatial skills, writing to
boost the language area, or debating to help your reasoning
networks. Interacting with other intelligent and interesting people is
one of the best ways to keep expanding your networks--in the brain and
in society.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k625] There is stronger evidence, however, that children who listen
to and play music at ages younger than eight do better on spatial
reasoning tests. For example, the California team studied a class of
three-year-olds. Half the class attended piano or singing lessons for
eight months. Their scores on puzzles, tests of spatial reasoning, and
drawing of geometric figures shot up to 80 percent higher than those
of their classmates who did not attend music lessons. The musical
children gradually became faster and more accurate at spatial
reasoning over the school year and boosted their spatial
intelligence. The theory is that as music is structured in space and
time, practicing it will strengthen circuits that help the brain think
and reason in space and time, important for math. If the effect of
sustained practice during childhood is permanent, the improved ability
will help children in complex math and engineering problems when they
grow up. It is theorized that the music triggers neural firing
patterns over large regions of the cortex that are also used for
spatial reasoning.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1039] An excess of mental noise in the brain can make it difficult
to perceive what's going on, overloading other circuits of attention,
memory, learning, cognition, emotional stability, or any other brain
function. The system goes into information overload. If random
neuronal firings are too fast and furious, incoming stimuli might fail
to activate and assemble the neurons into properly synchronized
behavior. This, in turn, could result in the incorrect processing of a
stimulus, and neurons would misfire accordingly. This is what can
happen when highly anxious people take tests. The heightened anxiety
drives up the mental noise, so much so that such people may literally
see less of their environment, as though the brain space usually open
for perception is busy with the internal noise.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1046] Our brains are not infinite. They run out of space, run out of
gas, as it were. If the brain is busy trying to filter uncomfortable
and frustrating noise, worries, or other concerns, there is less
"brain stuff" available for perceiving.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1428] It is easy to understand how the many processing difficulties
of autism can lead to social isolation. If one has an aversion to
being touched by another human being, if clothes feel like steel wool,
and if sensory information comes too fast and furiously for one to
process, a perfectly natural reaction is to avoid the overwhelming
stimuli in any way possible. Sadly, this social isolation, which
begins in early childhood when the brain is developing, sets up
behaviors that can last a lifetime.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1575] Like all of us, some dyslexics learn to tolerate this
inability to fit auditory information into models by becoming more
inventive in deciphering the sounds around them, perhaps by asking
probing questions all the time that help make sense of what is being
said and heard.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1678] To add to this complexity, recent physiological findings
suggest that all this processing takes place along several
independent, parallel pathways. One system processes information about
shape, one about color, and one about movement, location, and spatial
organization. If you look up and see a clock, the image of its face
and the action of its sweeping second hand are being processed
independently, despite how unified the image appears. It may seem
bizarre to think of vision as functionally subdivided. But how
otherwise could a person who has perfect focus and tracking of moving
objects be color-blind? Some "blind" people who cannot see colors or
objects can still see movement.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1784] With research in hand, I finally came to understand that my
mother has an exceptional parvo, slow-processing system; like most
artists, she expresses an enhanced perception of color. She also
expresses a mildly deficient magno, fast-processing system. I also
became aware that her brain "compensated" for its deficiency; and
finally, I put to rest the notion that perhaps my mother had a
slightly abnormal brain.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1794] My research assistant had not only found an underlying cause
for her mother's reading difficulty, she had also hit upon a central
conclusion about perception, and indeed all brain function. Each brain
is different, and each is more efficient at certain kinds of
processing than others. For most people, their plastic brain attempts
to reorganize to compensate for its deficiencies the best it can. The
more we learn about how this occurs, the more we will be able to help
the brain retrain itself.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1889] If the brain were simply reflexive, it would never be able to
plan a future action. The brain is a powerful prediction machine,
continuously making elaborate mental maps of the world that are
reliable enough to enable us to predict what lies ahead, both in space
and in time. All animals that move must have some predictive power--at
the very least a simple image of what they are moving into and a sense
of how they are moving into it.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1926] Scientists have identified four distinct components within the
attention system, which together create the brain's overall ability to
monitor the environment: arousal, motor orientation, novelty detection
and reward, and executive organization. At the lowest level of
monitoring, the brainstem maintains our vigilance--our general degree
of arousal. At the next level, the brain's motor centers allow us to
physically reorient our bodies so that we can immediately redirect our
senses to possible new villains or food sources. Then, the limbic
system accomplishes both novelty detection and reward. Finally, the
cortex--especially the frontal lobes--commands action and reaction and
integrates our attention with short- and long-term goals.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1971] A key area of action is this little group of cells, the
nucleus accumbens. Monkeys with lesions in this region are unable to
sustain attention, which hinders them in performing tasks that are not
rewarded immediately, therefore affecting motivation. ADHD can be
thought of as an addiction to the present. Patients are often
impulsive, lacking in inhibitions, and quick to act because they are
hooked on immediate feedback. They tend to prioritize tasks according
to which offers the most immediate gratification. As a result, they
tend to not interrupt current activities in order to rehearse skills
or evaluate the consequences of their actions.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2014] Since the 1930s, studies have linked the anterior cingulate
gyrus to attention, emotion, memory, somatic and autonomic motor
responses, motivation, and even responses to painful stimuli. One of
the keys to its widespread power is that it can regulate its own
dopamine levels, which enhance the reactivity of neural networks. It
also has extensive neural connections to regions throughout the brain,
helping it regulate other regions involved in attention. The complex
system of arousal, emotion, and motivation feeding the attention
system seems to be coordinated through the anterior cingulate gyrus.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
THE PRIMARY EMOTIONAL signal the anterior cingulate gyrus receives
comes from the amygdala, at the core of the limbic system, which
influences attention by assigning emotional significance to incoming
information. Even before a sensory perception has reached the frontal
lobes, where it enters conscious awareness and undergoes fine
categorization, the amygdala has already branded it with a raw
emotional valence somewhere along a continuum from mildly interesting
to "oh my God!" It activates the body and the rest of the brain in
response to how significant it deems the stimulus to be to
survival. If the stimulus seems threatening,
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2025] The amygdala provides a preconscious bias of intensity to
every stimulus you come into contact with, even before you actually
pay attention to it. It can, and does, operate outside consciousness.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2057] One of these, the D2R2 receptor gene, which codes for the D-2
receptors on the postsynaptic site for dopamine that is mainly
concentrated in the area of the limbic system, has an allele, or
alternative gene, that has been linked repeatedly with a variety of
psychiatric conditions such as alcoholism, ADHD, cocaine abuse,
nicotine addiction (better known as smoking), compulsive gambling, and
other addictions. These findings remain, but a number of studies now
show that there is a relationship--this is an association, not a
causal connection--between the D2 receptors and problems reward
and attention.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
It is believed that an abnormally low density of D2 receptors in the
nucleus accumbens reduces an individual's ability to experience
pleasure. This diminished capacity would almost inevitably drive that
individual to seek external forms of self-gratification. During the
course of a life, such strategies could settle into pathological
patterns of reward-seeking, from substance abuse to sexual conquest to
problem gambling. This has led Dr. Kenneth Blum of the University of
Texas and others to define a new syndrome called the "reward
deficiency syndrome."  Recognizing that a reward you are receiving is
"enough" is in part a function of memory, and sustaining attention is
the primary gate-way to the encoding of memories. Dopamine is central
to both attention and reward. What's more, substances such as
nicotine, cocaine, chocolate, marijuana, carbohydrates, and alcohol
increase the level of dopamine in this area of deficiency, so
searching for and ingesting these substances may be in part an attempt
to compensate for individual differences in dopamine levels. These
levels may also be increased rapidly by engaging in high-risk
behaviors, or by constantly confronting novel and challenging
situations. Putting yourself at prolonged risk, say,
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2072] The D2R2 allele, although present in only 20 to 25 percent of
the American population, was found to be present in 70 percent of
severe alcoholics dying from cirrhosis of the liver. These findings,
presented to the public in 1990, stirred up a flurry of debate in the
media, which immediately jumped to the conclusion that the "alcoholism
gene" had been discovered.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2095] Most often, ADHD individuals are deficient in the motivational
sensations of pleasure or pain, and as a result they struggle to
sustain the drive required to complete important but tedious tasks
that only reward after a long period of time, such as doing well in
school to eventually take on college or a career.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2149] WHETHER IT FUNCTIONS smoothly or not, the ultimate purpose of
our attention system is to help our brains tune in to the world,
including our own minds. Tuning in opens the door to that most
fascinating aspect of our lives: consciousness. People love to debate
consciousness. Considering that we don't know what it is or how it
works, the fervor with which it is debated can be embarrassingly
presumptuous.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2250] CONSCIOUSNESS One of the most appealing explanations of
consciousness is the proposal that the recurrent network set up
between the thalamus and the cortex is the neurology of
consciousness. The thalamus is connected to the cortex by the
intralaminar nuclei, which project long axons to all areas of the
cerebral hemispheres. These areas in turn send back projections to the
same intralaminar nuclei, and when this circuit is humming with a
steady oscillation, consciousness may result.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2410] The next frontier in the quest to explain consciousness is the
hard question of subjective experience. We all know what a subjective
experience is, but it's hard even to explain what we experience. The
most central subjective experience we have is "what it is like to be
me from the inside." Examining consciousness from the inside reveals a
whole new set of "data" to be explained--the qualitative aspects of
our experiences, or, for short, qualia. The term qualia is currently
in vogue in the field of philosophy of the mind. Qualia are the
phenomenological properties of experience; the "what it is like" of
consciousness that are elements that can only be known from one
subjective standpoint. For example, you cannot experience another
person's pain. You can infer what the other person is going through,
but there is no direct transfer of the experience. Other examples of
qualia might be, for instance, deja vu, a chilling dive into a cold
river, or the smell of burnt rubber.
@/blockquote

I do not understand altruismm in this context. Altruism is a
quality like anything else.

@blockquote
[k2423] As we attend more and are more conscious about what is going
on around us, we have more freedom, while at the same time we are more
bound to the reality of the world. We can think of an increasing
consciousness as an expanding playground for creativity, where we can
learn in new ways how the world is put together. Altruism and
consciousness are the steps that we're walking through that will
define us more in the future.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2453] Motor function is as crucial to some forms of cognition as it
is to physical movement. It is equally crucial to behavior, because
behavior is the acting out of movements prescribed by cognition. If we
can better understand movement, we can better understand thoughts,
words, and deeds.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2473] Nature is a frugal tinkerer.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2518] The typical OCDer is a perfectionist who is interminably
searching for error. He or she explodes with worry and gets caught in
a never-ending do-loop of concern and rumination. Did I make the right
move?
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2547] Cases like T.J.'s stunned practicing psychiatrists, virtually
all of whom had been schooled in the classic Freudian view that OCD
somehow stemmed from a disturbance in toilet training. Acute-onset
cases like T.J.'s totally upset the traditional psychodynamic,
interpretative framework for the disease, even the updated,
biologically aware versions that put some blame on an imbalance of
serotonin. These children were virtually "catching" OCD, or at least
tics, the way a person catches a cold. There was nothing social about
it. MRI scans revealed that in these children the caudate nucleus, the
area implicated in OCD, had swollen to as much as 24 percent larger
than normal. What's more, the degree of swelling directly correlated
with the severity of the OCD symptoms. Researchers surmised that the
antibodies created to attack the strep bacteria were attacking the
caudate neurons of the children's brains.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2572] A lot of brain function is, essentially, movement.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2584] Movement is fundamental to the very existence of a
brain. Interestingly, only an organism that moves from place to place
requires a brain. Plants enhance their chances for photosynthesis by
turning their leaves to face the sun, but this is done through the
growth of cells, not by changing their position. A tiny marine
creature known as the sea squirt swims about like a tadpole. It has a
brain and a nerve cord to control its movements. However, when it
matures, it attaches itself permanently to a rock. From that moment
on, the brain and the nerve cord are gradually absorbed and
digested. The sea squirt consumes its own brain because it is not
needed anymore.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2671] We therefore have to be very wary when we are presented with a
nice, neat map of the brain. For six decades investigators have
created brain maps that reflect the "latest" research. The maps have
evolved from well-defined point-to-point grids to messy configurations
showing complex overlapping areas. The phrenologist and the geographer
live within us: we want to know where and how. But this is just not
the way the brain is organized.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2887] What's even more fascinating is that the motor control of
movements related to emotion is not in the same location as the
control for a voluntary movement of the same kind. For example, when a
stroke destroys the motor cortex in the brain's left hemisphere, the
patient experiences paralysis on the right side of the face. When
asked to smile the patient cannot move the right side of his
mouth. However, when the same patient is told a joke and laughs
spontaneously, the smile is normal; both sides of the mouth move as
they should. The cortex cannot exercise its usual control over the
muscles, but the muscles still respond to the more automatic and
implicitly learned responses that are located on the first floor--the
basal ganglia.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2911] Our motor programs continually reorganize into sequences of
motor movements that reflect what we learn each time, to lead to
well-thought-out and successful performance. We are always modifying
and learning through movement.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2942] Our physical movements can directly influence our ability to
learn, think, and remember. It has been shown that certain physical
activi-ties that have a strong mental component, such as soccer or
tennis, enhance social, behavioral, and academic abilities. Although
the reasons are not completely understood, many reports indicate that
this is so. Evidence is mounting that each person's capacity to master
new and remember old information is improved by biological changes in
the brain brought on by physical activity. Certain kinds of exercise
can produce chemical alterations that give us stronger, healthier, and
happier brains.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k2969] Studies suggest that challenge and feedback are necessary to
maximize learning. The brain is exquisitely designed to operate on
feedback, both internal and external. The substantia nigra,
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3003] What am I talking about? False memories. We all have
them. Despite our great certainty about what we have and have not
experienced, the fact is that given a few bogus details and a little
prodding, about a quarter of adults can be convinced that they
remember childhood adventures they never had. Our memories are much
more malleable and fallible than we like to think.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3153] This process, however, is not standardized. Motivation can
affect how encoded a memory becomes. Michael Merzenich did much of the
early work in showing that when there is a reward, the pieces of a
memory are more strongly bonded. He placed a slowly spinning wheel
beside monkeys' cages, which the monkeys could touch with their
fingertips, and monitored the region of their brains responsible for
the fingers. The cells responsible for feeling the wheel and
remembering the sensation were mapped. Merzenich then added a learning
task; when the monkeys could recognize a designated pattern of
spinning and press a buzzer, they were given a food reward. They soon
became experts at recognizing the right pattern, and literally within
hours the nerve cells responsible for the task multiplied as the
monkeys' discriminatory powers increased. Neighboring neurons were
recruited to help perceive and then remember the perception. The
adding of a reward led to having many more neurons code the
memories. The monkeys were motivated to remember the event. The adage
that reward is part of learning is backed up by real neuronal proof.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3178] More evidence comes from the evolutionary ladder. In the one
mammal that does not experience REM sleep, the spiny anteater, the
prefrontal cortex--the major center of learning and behavior--is so
disproportionately large relative to the animal's body mass that
memories are encoded at the moment an event is first
experienced. Higher mammals, lacking this massive reservoir, were
perhaps forced to develop and reserve REM sleep as a time for
solidifying memories; recall the study showing that the exact neuronal
firing patterns present when rats explored a maze were repeated
precisely when the rats were in REM sleep.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3246] Problems with working memory are crucial to the many symptoms
of ADHD. Those of us blessed with proper working memory can predict
the consequences of our actions: we have memory of the future. People
with ADHD lack this gift. Planning overwhelms them, and they "forget
to remember" and "forget to remember that they will exist in the
future" and so on until everything falls into an unproductive infinite
regress. Further, they lack an ability to screen out extraneous
stimuli.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3585] Cognitive changes assumed to accompany aging are seriously
misunderstood. Many people, for example, confuse normal age-associated
memory changes with the severe clinical condition of Alzheimer's
disease, a form of senile dementia. Statistics show that no more than
10 to 15 percent of people from age sixty-five to one hundred show
symptoms of clinically diagnosed senile dementia, yet thanks to
prompting--or perhaps priming--by the popular press, a great majority
of the aging population would swear to having the disease. Some memory
loss is common as people get older, and it differs significantly from
dementia. In normal aging, individuals may have a "tip-of-the-tongue"
memory loss for words that haven't been used in a while. That's why
Grandma, having a "senior moment," may confuse her grandchildren's
names when they first come to visit after having not seen them for
several months. With Alzheimer's, people lose the names for common
objects they run into every day, like glasses or ovens.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3948] Sadness probably evolved to emphasize and underscore losses of
all kinds; it takes us off-line so that we can regroup and
reevaluate. It may even cause us enough "pain" that we are motivated
to change. In the brain,
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k3986] Depression affects 3 to 5 percent of the population at any
given time, and about 20 percent of people will experience major
depression in their lifetimes. Even children only five or six years
old can experience symptoms clinically similar to adult
depression. Depression is less genetically based than any other mental
illness, and is the one most dependent on environmental factors.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4135] A disorder of the motivation system is apathy, which can have
a neurological basis or accompany another medical disorder. Apathy can
be particularly difficult to treat because the behavior may be seen by
the patient's family as moral weakness or be misinterpreted by a
therapist as passive-aggressive behavior.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4140] High doses of dopamine are usually needed to help patients
suffering from apathy. In one study, seven out of eight patients who
became depressed following liver transplants and were given
methylphenidate, or Ritalin, a drug that elevates dopamine levels,
showed improved motivation in pursuing their rehabilitation regimens
and less social withdrawal and apathy than they exhibited before
taking the drug. For apathy patients, drugs are not the final
cure. They also need assistance in practicing techniques to help
themselves. Education of the family is an important job for the
therapist, too. Treatment of apathy raises some complex human rights
issues, because these patients may be competent enough to make some
decisions but not others. They are also prone to anxiety, which must
be relieved so that they will consider options and get involved with
life again. Treating apathy is also important in depressed
patients. Drugs can be used to bring about rapid improvement at an
early stage. Since depressed patients are often convinced that nothing
can be done for them, they may not adhere to the treatment plan, and
become uncooperative and neglectful. Rapid countering of this resigned
apathy is an essential aspect of treatment.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4181] As we evolved and our social groups got bigger and more
complex, we needed to delay and react more deliberately or chaos would
have reigned. Language may have evolved as a delay mechanism.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4186] It is the moment of delay that is so crucial to planned
action. Owing to language, we don't have to act immediately on
emotional impulses determined by our immediate surroundings.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4648] Electrical stimulation studies on the conscious brain have
helped define the reading areas. They overlap with naming sites, but
aren't always in the same area, and exact locations vary from one
individual to another, as is the case for naming sites for oral
language. Other tests show that people with high verbal IQs have
reading sites in the superior temporal gyrus and naming sites in the
middle temporal gyrus. Ironically, the reverse pattern is found in
people with weaker verbal skills. William Calvin of the University of
Washington proposes one explanation: We learn to name before we learn
to read. If we are genetically less efficient at this task, the
greater neural area in the superior temporal gyrus is necessary for
success. So when we begin to learn the complex task of reading when we
start school, the superior temporal gyrus is already dedicated to
naming sites, so reading sites form in the less optimal middle
temporal gyrus.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4669] Whether schools should teach reading by phonics versus whole
language has become a hot, almost political debate, but brain research
provides a simple answer: they should use both. The whole-language
trend assumes that reading is a natural, genetically programmed part
of language development, and that children will pick it up as easily
as speaking. However, as noted, since writing has only existed for
5,000 years and literacy has only been widespread for a few centuries,
it is highly unlikely that the human brain has evolved structures
specifically for reading and writing in this time. It is our ability
to learn through experience that allows us to achieve reading, but
only with explicit instruction.

@blockquote
[k4796] The process of writing may provide an even greater delaying
function, allowing for even more organization of ideas before
action. So many of us claim that we can organize our thoughts better
and learn new tasks more easily if we sit down and write them out on a
piece of paper. Perhaps journal writing would be a useful
rehabilitation tool to train our brains to slow down, think, and
vocalize before acting on emotion or acting out in a social
situation--the subject of our next chapter.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4899] The more I see the pieces put together, the more I am
convinced that there is indeed a social brain. The pieces have long
been identified, but we do not think of them as constituting a
holistic function.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4903] This simple declaration may seem heretical to some.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4907] If we can understand how the social brain works, we can begin
to find ways to treat people whose behavior crosses the limits
tolerated by our social society. More important, we might find a way
to give otherwise isolated and anguished people the ability to make
friends, get along with co-workers, and form intimate
relationships. Even though we typically think of these emotional,
psychological, or moral capacities as learned, the existence of a
social brain indicates that our social skills also have a partly
biological basis.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4922] Our highest human virtue is our connection with other humans,
and social activity is basic to our health and happiness. Our brains
are preprogrammed to look for other humans from the moment of birth,
and continuing social interaction with parents and peers is essential
for normal development throughout life.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4957] The lesson is that practice can make perfect. Some schools are
realizing this, and are beginning to put class time aside, even if
it's as little as 15 minutes a week, to help children learn how to be
friends, how to recognize and talk about different feelings, how to
handle anger or pain, and how to express what they like and
dislike. Teachers will act out situations--
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k4963] Modern society has canonized successful social relationships
as the ultimate in psychological adaptation, and much of psychology
and psychoanalysis is based on this premise. But there is a definite
neurological component to this exalted function, and the possibility
of correcting the brain's social neurology has been largely ignored.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5033] Often it is easier for an individual to participate in an
exchange relationship than to do everything for himself. Once you open
a door for yourself, it requires only a bit of extra effort to
continue to hold it for the person behind you. This little effort is
rewarded with a lessening of your own burden when someone else holds a
door open for you. This economic principle, which surfaces as little
politenesses, helps make civilized society possible.

@blockquote
[k5200] This motor activity then helps her calm down. Alternatively,
as the woman's anxiety heightens, someone may approach her who has a
friendly expression and a quieting tone of voice and give her a
reassuring touch on the arm. This raises the woman's serotonin level,
which dampens the network, tells the cortex to quiet down and the
amygdala to reduce its vigilance for there is no longer a threat.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5581] This view leads to a radically different but simple model for
analyzing human experience, which delves far below the emotional
surface of feelings while recognizing that emotion conditions the
entire process. The model consists of four "theaters" of exploration,
which flow and feed back into one another: perception captures
incoming stimuli; attention, consciousness, and cognition filter and
process these perceptions; the brain functions then work with this
information and affect how subsequent information is perceived and
processed; the final result is behavior and, ultimately, identity. By
logically investigating each theater, clinicians--and people
themselves--can find the fundamental cause of difficulties and design
lasting cures.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
THE TRADITIONAL EFFORT to uncover the hidden trauma supposedly
responsible for suffering is largely being replaced today by searches
for neurotransmitter imbalances, aberrant genes, and altered brain
functions. Where we once spoke of superego, ego, and id, we now speak
of serotonin, gene sequences, and neural networks in various brain
regions. Nevertheless, mental health practitioners continue trying to
treat affect directly, as if it were the illness itself, rather than
attempting to investigate the ways in which it might be a consequence
of a patient's underlying disorders. Furthermore, they continue to
insist on a Pasteurian notion of illness: one pathogen, one antigen,
one cure.  The pressing desire to provide immediate relief also leaves
many doctors and patients addicted to the search for a convenient,
comforting diagnostic label and a hot new drug to cure the
affliction. The hunt for a single villainous gene for each behavioral
problem is just as intoxicating, and the media have fostered
unwarranted hopes among the general public, which now plainly expects
miracle cures for suffering. This trend is unfortunate and
distressing.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5602] Although psychiatry has finally achieved recognition as a
medical science, drug therapy is still a crude and primitive tool for
treating an organ we are only beginning to understand. Which faculties
and sources of satisfaction should a psychiatric patient expect to
surrender for the sake of therapeutic convenience?
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5625] Feelings may be the cause of distress, but they also cover up
the problem. Furthermore, in light of the paucity of our understanding
of the brain, it seems more productive for clinicians to replace
confidence in diagnostic categories with curiosity and a knowing
humanity.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
Even if emotions are largely the cause of a problem, those emotions
are created by the physical firing of neurons in the
brain. Furthermore, even if an emotional trauma is the root cause of a
problem, that trauma reorganizes the brain's circuits--a biological
result that can be turned around.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5670] My hope is that with the metaphorical framework of the four
theaters we can begin to base modern mental health care on a more
holistic method of healing. By starting upstream and working their way
down, psychiatrists stand a better chance of identifying the true
etiologies of the disorders they seek to treat and of engineering the
environment in such a way that patients' internal shortcomings are met
with self-forgiveness and effective steps to correct their
problems.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
The First Theater--Perception THE BRAIN DOES NOT mechanically store
the information that it acquires. It is changed forever each and every
time it interacts with the world. Each time, it becomes the
information. Perception is the gateway through which we receive
information from our five senses and from our internal
awareness. Perception is the beginning of all experience.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5684] A lifetime of misperceptions leaves many patients
ashamed of their limitations and fearful of repeating
failures. Perception is the starting point for diagnosis, because
mental life develops primarily in response to the information that the
brain apprehends. The Second Theater--Attention, Consciousness, and
Cognition WHEN WE ATTEND to a perception, we become conscious of it,
and then we think about it or react to it. The second theater
encompasses a person's conscious experience of the world. It is how a
person represents the world to himself or herself, from moment to
moment, and how he or she interprets events within it. Upstream
problems in perception
@/blockquote

@blockquote
The quality of one's inner awareness can deteriorate as poorly formed
perceptions fail to provide the structural basis for well-coordinated
attention shifts, and as ill-formed cognitive networks lead to
confused internal representations of the world. This leaves the brain
trapped in a state of constant "noise" and starved for accurate
information.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5696] The Third Theater--Brain Function THE THIRD THEATER comprises
the primary functions of the brain, movement, memory, emotion,
language, and the social brain, all of them affected by differences
between the brain's hemispheres. These processes directly influence
the moment-by-moment experience of life, yet adapt relatively slowly.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5702] Brain functions lie downstream from the first two theaters in
our model because they emerge and develop in response to whatever
kinds of experiences enter consciousness from perception. A second
theater filled with mental noise can distort functions in the third in
numerous ways, including ADHD, OCD, autism, anxiety disorders, and
others.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5722] The Fourth Theater--Identity and Behavior THE FOURTH THEATER
constitutes the "output" of the brain: one's decisions, behavior, and
historical sense of self. It is the sum total of neurological and
psychological traits that, at any given moment, constitute who a
person has become. This theater is, in a sense, the space occupied by
the life narrative that individuals tell themselves--and their
care-givers. It is also where modern psychiatry has spent most of its
time, for it is where we confront early traumas, lowered self-esteem,
fantasies, phobias, behavioral troubles, broken marriages, character
disorders, and personality. A patient's quest for accurate
self-knowledge begins in the fourth theater. The obvious problem, of
course, is that a life of long-compromising influences flowing in from
upstream alters one's own self-observation, self-esteem, sense of
self, and memory.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5890] The possibilities for change are bounded only by our
imagination, our willingness to assess our brains accurately through
self-reflection, and our commitment to do some hard work.
@/blockquote

He gets grandiose at times.

@blockquote
[k5907] Not so. The brilliantly simple evidence from exciting new
areas of physical and social science--complexity theory and tipping
points--shows how powerful such universal factors can be in affecting
the brain-body system.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5966] Several studies show that older men who have stayed in shape
do better on mental tests than those who have not; indeed, they do
just as well as men thirty to forty years younger. Aging brains may
also decline in function owing to lower levels of dopamine crossing
the synapses. Physical exercise elevates these dopamine levels.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k5984] Hatha-yoga has been found to decrease excitability,
aggressiveness, and somatic complaints and to enhance emotional and
life satisfaction.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k6235] Any activity that gives us a sense of purpose and
accomplishment, that makes us feel glad to be alive, can help us care
for and feed our brain. Many people put off doing what they love, or
what they know they need to do for themselves, until later in life,
trying to get the world's demands out of the way first. What a grave
mistake! It is far better to make sure that part of our lives is
consumed with activities that we can put all our hearts, minds,
energies, and joys into at once.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k6242] Remember one important point: In pursuing your passion, the
actual doing is what matters, not any measure of success. A diet of
constant, stimulating activity is the best prescription for our
troubles. It keeps the brain in a state of constant change, flow,
confirmation, and anticipation, thereby reducing the noise, fragility,
self-doubt, and stagnation with which we all have to contend.
