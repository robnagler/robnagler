I am a programmer.  Over the years, I've written a lot about
[Programming](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+programming).
This site collects some of these works, and is the repository for new articles.

My opinions about programming and other subjects change over time.
For example, my book
[Extreme Perl](http://www.extremeperl.org) was my early thinking on
how to devolve responsibility in a team.
The methodology parts are too structured, and are not consistent with
how I evolve software now, which is much more ad hoc.

[Evolution](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+evolution)
factors big in my current thinking about software.  This
wasn't always the case.  I was a big fan of the waterfall model in the
1980s until I saw people and relationships as the core issue.
Programming-in-the-large requires a
[team of trust](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+team+trust).

Code evolves by integrating
[feedback](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+feedback).
The more feedback, the better.
A team of trust is fearless and can accept any feedback thrown at it.
Team members are never fearless.  Only in a team do we create a bond
of trust that enables us to overcome our particular fears in any one
instance.

[Psychology](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+psychology)
figures centrally in my life and work.
I strive to understand how my psyche affects my
actions and reactions. I used to visit a psychologist regularly to help me
integrate the feedback the real world threw at me. I'm better able to
do this on my own now, but I also rely on my
incredibly supportive family, friends, and work colleagues.

In addition to conversations, my opinions are informed by my reading.
You can find many
[notes on books I find interesting](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:robnagler.com+BookNotes)
on this site. I've been trying to keep up more with my notes no
recent books, and I've got years of pending notes that I need to
backfill.

Work is an extremely important part of my life.  I have had rapture of
the bits since I was nine.  I have always worked in software, and continue
to do so.  [Check my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robnagler)
where I'm working now.

This page will evolve over time.  It'll reflect my current thinking on
a variety of subjects, and serve as a jumping off point of what I
think is relevant. Alternatively, you can sign up [for the RSS feed](feed.xml)
for recent updates.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your feedback. You can email
me at robnagler.com.

Cheers,<br />
