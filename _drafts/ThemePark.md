I grew up with [a serial killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Rifkin) so I ought to know.

A corporation is [a legal person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person).

I grew up with a future serial killer
and in the last two weeks, I visited Universal Studios, Warner Brothers Studios,
Disney Epcot, and the Kennedy Space Center. While I didn't know
[Joel Rifkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Rifkin) was a psychopath
at the time, I've come to believe that Theme Parks are.

In many countries, a corporation is [a legal person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person).
Theme Parks are corporations and therefore persons, but can we think of them as having
personalities

Good vs evil portrayed simply. Us vs Them. Not about inclusion and working together.

The foreign attractions are propaganda pieces for the "happy path" in countries. Nothing about the pain people feel: Beautiful country side and castles. Nothing about the serfs toiling.

Epcot is not updated. Movies are decades old, e.g. old hong kong airport in portrayal of hong kong

gas lighting. you are having fun. if you aren't having fun, there's something wrong with you.

Very few characters walking around these days. As mechanical as possible. Most people are there to take money.

Over stimulation so you don't have time to think slowly; they want fast thinking, buy this, ride that.

Virtual reality exhibits are cheaper to make, to control environment (great in the rain), and to insure, but are they better? People get more sick (at least in our group).

Parking (sunk cost), security, buy ticket, then fingerprint

Website sucked, confusing, forcing upgrades.

Every little exhibit has something for sale. Diagonalley was all about buying things.

How do people afford it? Hundreds of dollars.

finger print or photo id. the latter is actually worse, because they scan your picture, as well.

No option to enter for the day and if you leave, you're done. Would not need to fingerprint, and likely to be the majority of visitors. Nobody leaves b/c parking is $25 or $50 (express).

cameras everywhere

No security, just waving people through when busy. It's about not bringing in food.

Forgoing fingerprints when busy

Asked for photo id with credit card, but that wasn't enough to validate the user. Have to go to guest services and present photo id.
