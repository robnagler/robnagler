["There's a sucker born every minute."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_a_sucker_born_every_minute)
As a kid, I heard this a lot. I grew up with skeptics all around
me. We were always trying to trick each other into believing something
that was not true, or convincing ourselves that we weren't suckers.

I've been watching [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)
recently. Much of the humor is centered around being a sucker or
not. Jerry says, "I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers." Kramer
says, "Retail is for suckers." George, "Ich bin ein sucker."

Scientists are not suckers, or so I grew up believing. The scientific
method evaluates facts to get to the truth, or if you believe Popper,
[verisimilitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude) --
closer to the truth.

Believers are suckers. I'm not a believer, but yet I am. I'm a sucker
for not believing that I believe. I have empathy for believers, and I
believe that it helps them. ("It's great they can believe.) But I
don't believe that belief will help me.

Yet belief is all I have. I write this article in the belief that it
will be worthwile. That it will
[maximize my utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_maximization_problem).
I grew up believing in
[Homo Economicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus),
which has fallen out of fashion.

Utility maximization is a reasonable theory that is useless in
practice. It is not because we are irrational actors. Rather, just the
opposite. According to Yuval Noah Harari, ["Large numbers of strangers
can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths."

We believe therefore it exists.

Lately there has been a strange crossing of science and belief. Crypto
curriences (Bitcoin, Ether, etc.) are scientifically proven to be
unique and scarce. Lots of things are unique and scarce. For example,
each of our DNA sequences is unique and scarce. Other examples include
quantum state, ownership (stock) in a corporation, and the path of
a meteor through the atmosphere. The difference these various
sequences of bits is the belief in their economic utility.

Cryptocurrencies is useful now, but it was not in 2009. If
