["There's a sucker born every minute."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_a_sucker_born_every_minute)
As a kid, I heard this a lot. I grew up with skeptics all around
me. We were always trying to trick each other into believing something
that was not true, or convincing ourselves that we weren't suckers.

I've been watching [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld)
recently. Much of the humor is centered around being a sucker or
not. Jerry says, "I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers." Kramer
says, "Retail is for suckers." George, "Ich bin ein sucker."

Scientists are not suckers, or so I grew up believing. The scientific
method evaluates facts to get to the truth, or if you believe Popper,
[verisimilitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude) --
closer to the truth.

Believers are suckers. I'm not a believer, but yet I am. I'm a sucker
for not believing that I believe. I have empathy for believers, and I
believe that it helps them. ("It's great they can believe.) But I
don't believe that belief will help me.

Yet belief is all I have. I write this article in the belief that it
will be worthwile. That it will
[maximize my utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_maximization_problem).
I grew up believing in
[Homo Economicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus),
which has fallen out of fashion.

Utility maximization is a reasonable theory that is useless in
practice. It is not because we are irrational actors. Rather, just the
opposite. According to Yuval Noah Harari, ["Large numbers of strangers
can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths."

We believe therefore it exists.

Lately there has been a strange crossing of science and belief. Crypto
curriences (Bitcoin, Ether, etc.) are scientifically proven to be
unique and scarce. Lots of things are unique and scarce. For example,
each of our DNA sequences is unique and scarce. Other examples include
quantum state, ownership (stock) in a corporation, and the path of
a meteor through the atmosphere. The difference these various
sequences of bits is the belief in their economic utility.

Bitcoin is useful now, but it was not in 2009.

FOMO is belief.

This article really misses that point, and tries to equate all things
as belief:
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-show-value-owning-unownable/618525/
CDOs were about leverage, not belief. The belief is that leverage is
risk-free in certain situations, when it isn't.
NFTs are not about leverage, but about FOMO-belief. Keeping up with
the Jonses.

There's a belief that Bitcoin will be useful, that it will replace
other currencies such as dollars. That belief is driving some of the
cryptocurrency action. "The is real, finally", I think might be the
sentiment. This is not about FOMO, but about Bitcoin (BTC) is here to stay
so we might as well own some.

I don't believe that. One of the reasons is that I have a bit of
experience working in the foreign exchange (Forex, FX) industry.

One of
the concepts in FX is
[foreign exchange risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_risk)
(FX Risk). You take on FX Risk when you plan a trip to
another country. Let's say you were living in the UK in 2008, and
you wanted to visit the US in the fall.
Many of your UK friends told you how great their trip was, and how
cheap everything was during their trips in 2007.
You planned your holiday in the summer, when the GBP-USD exchange rate was
about 2:1, that is, one pound would be exchanged for about two
dollars.

You budgeted 4,000 GBP for the trip. You already bought your plane
tickets and reserved your hotels. You haven't paid for the hotels, but
you did pay for the plane. Let's say your flight cost 1,000 GBP. That
leaves 3,000 GBP for hotels, food, transporation, and
entertainment. As the trip approaches, the GBP-USD starts
dropping. By Sep 2008, it's down to 1.77, and still
heading south. You trip is in Oct.

Your trip is going to cost your 20% more than you originally
budgeted, because the rate dropped to 1.65 by the end of October. Do
you have an extra 600 GBP? Should you cancel your
flight and not go? When you first planned bought the ticket, you
probably didn't think of the FX Risk, because the rates were going up
(in your favor).

Now, imagine you are a US company, and you decide to accept BTC,
because prices are going up. The goal of accepting BTC, of course, is
to get more customers. Companies take on FX Risk to acquire customers
in foreign markets. Sometimes they don't enter another country due to too much
risk. If the demand is high enough, they will.

The same has to be true of the FX Risk associated with BTC. Your home
currency is USD. You pay your employees in USD. (Note that at the time
of this writing all the major crypto exchanges pay their employees in
USD, too.) You make the decision to accept BTC, because you reason
that BTC is here to stay, and the price is going up. What could be the
harm if BTC goes down, a little?

That question is only half of the risk calculation. As I said,
companies take on FX Risk to gain access to foreign markets. But BTC
is not a foreign market, it's just a foreign currency. Will more
customers buy your products now that you accept BTC? That's a risk,
too. Indeed, the customers may arbitrage the price of your products
based upon whether BTC-USD is going up or down. In other words, by
accepting two currencies in your home country, you are almost
guaranteed to lose money. If BTC-USD is going up, they will buy in
USD, because it is "cheaper". If it is going down, they will spend
their less valuable BTC.

This argument is not specious, because the type of people who hold
BTC today are definitely looking at the BTC-USD rates. They are
actively trading BTC-USD, and they are thinking about how to make
money of it. Their approach to FX arbitrage will also apply to
purchase currency arbitrage.

This already happens today. Many people have different credit cards
that they use. People love to use Discover to pay for gas, because
they get 5% cash back. They use their regular 2% cash back cards for
other purchases. Maybe they also have an Amazon Prime card which gives
them 5% cash back on Amazon and Whole Foods purchases.

Why do businesses issue their own cards? Loyalty. If I have an Amazon
card, I'm more likely to buy from Amazon. In this case, companies get
more sales for the cost of a different kind of payment
system. Customers will switch to that payment system, because it costs
them less to buy things. It's a win-win-win, because the credit card
make a profit on each transaction.

For e-commerce, there's the added benefit that the credit card
companies assume the risk of fraud. Customers don't have to worry
about their credit cards getting stolen. The credit card companies
just assume the loss, because they control the validity of the
transaction. I'll also throw in the benefit of getting a free month of
float on the purchase price. Customers only have to pay for their
purchase a month later.

BTC is a new kind of payment system. Your business will switch to it,
because it will generate loyalty. But why? Except for a few diehard
anti-fiat currency people, most people will still use credit
cards. When you buy something with BTC, the customer not only assumes
an FX risk, but you also assume all fraud risk. Once a BTC transaction
is validated, it's in the blockchain, and your fraction of a BTC is
gone, forever. If the business fails to deliver, you lost.

If you use USD credit card, you'll actually get a discount from the payment
system. If you use BTC, it's just like cash so nobody is going to pay
you to use it. That's not quite true, of course, certain gas stations
charge you to use credit cards. Some companies prefer being paid by
check. It's possible those companies would accept BTC.

I left out yet another risk: accounting/audit risk. Your financial
books just got more complicated when you accept another currency. You
now need Quickbooks Enterprise, which understand currencies. You have
to input the exchange rate every day (or more frequently) so you can
produce reports. Your financial statements got more complicated, too,
and this means you have an increase audit risk that you made a
mistake.

Let's also not forget that as of this writing there are 5,000
cryptocurrencies. Which one do you choose? BTC is clearly the largest,
but Ether (ETH) and Binance (BNB) have significant market caps. If you
choose more than one, you've now given your customers more arbitrage
opportunities without gaining market share. I'd argue that one
cryptocurrency is the same as another from the anti-fiat-money
people.

### Scientific Currency

Bitcoin is the [Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) of
currencies. According to Wikipedia, Esperanto is the "world's most
widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language." Quite an
accomplishment, but very few people reading this will know what
Esperanto is, or know that it was in invented in 1887.

Crypto as an asset class will not go away. That's actually the point
of this article: belief has trumped science. The science, or the
reason for the invention was: [A purely peer-to-peer version
of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly
from one party to another without going through a financial
institution](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).
Belief says that the asset is worth something, similar to
beanie babies. No one believes my father's paintings are valuable even
though he is dead, and there are a very limited number, and everyone
who sees them thinks they are beautiful. (I specifically did not put a
picture here, because it's not the point, and I don't want to prove
anything about their beauty. Meaning, it's a personal thing.)

Scarcity is not enough. It has to be believed to be valuable, and
crypto is believed to be valuable.

### Physical vs Digital Goods

Bitcoin is useful as a means for paying for
[digital goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_goods),
especially
[virtual goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_goods),
because the transaction can take place on a neutral exchange, and be
secure. The virtual good, like payment, has to be secure from
duplicate transactions. That exchange can be transacted
completely via computer.

Physical goods cannot be exchanged via computer. It's impossible. You
can have a receipt, but the actual good must be transferred from the
seller to the buyer by some physical means. There needs to be some
other assurance that the physical transaction has taken place. This
can be an escrow mechanism via a trusted third party, an in person
exchange, or an insured transaction (e.g. credit cards).

Should I discuss this?

[cross rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/crossrate.asp),
which are exchange rates not based in US dollars (USD). Back in the
day, there was almost no trading in cross rates, everything went
through dollars. We had cross rate formulas that would take into
account two
[spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/090914/understanding-spread-retail-currency-exchange-rates.asp)
(one for going into dollars, and another for
leaving dollars). There's a real cost still to trading between
non-popular currencies.


From a friend:

One BTC observation: I think some companies are taking positions just
in case the price does climb enough (even temporarily) to give
competitors with holdings an advantage, either in real liquidity or
some intangible e.g. glowing stories in the media. The price tanking
isn't an issue if everyone is in (given nothing else productive to do
with the cash), since public perception would focus on the failings of
BTC itself instead of the wisdom of conservative holdouts (unless they
find a way to 'short' and see a return on their prescience).

Individual investors have greater anti-BTC latitude:

So, I'll be thinking about the relationship between perception and
belief on my (much longer) hike today.
