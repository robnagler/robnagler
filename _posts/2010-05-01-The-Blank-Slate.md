By Steven Pinker, Viking, September 26, 2002, 978-0670031511

Steven Pinker is a psychology professor.  The book is about a theory
of human behavior, but first he sets up the epistemology of the way we
think about human behavior.  The three laws he presents throw out much
of what we believe, and in particular, the Tabula Rasa, the Blank
Slate (empiricism) we think all humans are when they are born.  Cold
moms cause autism and schizophrenia is caused by double binds.  Genes
have nothing to do with it.  While you may not believe this literal
bold statement, you probably believe in some of the other theories
which dominate the nature vs nurture debate

The other two important theories of behavior which Pinker debunks are
the Noble Savage (romanticism) and the Ghost in the Machine (dualism).
We are innocent babes, Noble Savages, who just need to be shown The
Way.  Society's structures are ill-formed to help keep us that way.
Oh to be children again.  What explains the Lord of the Flies we
commonly see on playgrounds?

The Ghost in the Machine comes from Judeo-Christian philosphy.  The
soul is this ethereal entity, distinct from our bodies.  The soul
does not behave according to physical laws (Descartes).  Rather, our
minds are us, and our bodies might not actually exist.  Hobbes tried
to convince us that our minds and bodies are mechanical entities, and
there is no such thing as free will.  We are no different than
insects.

Pinker in the argues that genetics drive 50% of our behavior and 50%
on the unique environment (as opposed to the shared environment of the
home) in our lives.  Kids are different, because their genes differ.
Identical twins are different, because their peers (and the outside
world in general) treat them differently.  Parents have little to do
with the behavior of their children.

As a parent, the second (home life is irrelevant) and third (peers
rule) laws were the hardest to swallow.  I see genes at play, but I
feel like I'm the cause of my kids bad behavior (and rarely their good
behavior, which I attribute to genes).  After reading the whole book,
I have to say that Pinker makes sense of what I have seen.  A trivial
but concrete example, my kids talk with a Colorado accent, even though
my wife and I are not from here, and we spent most of their
"formative" years talking to them as the Good Books say we should.  My
best friend growing up spoke Spanish with his parents but with a New
York accent.

The Blank Slate is an excellent and well-written book.  You'll be
surprised by the many studies he presents.  You might even change your
beliefs about parenting and why we act the way we do.

The word invented struck me oddly when I first read it in this
sentence, but it makes sense. When we modify an existing system, we
are inventing a new one. We often think of inventions coming out of
thin air but they don't. Inventions never occur in a vacuum just like
evolution started at the time of the big bang and is going forward
incrementally ever since.

Pinker goes to great lengths to discuss the details associated
with the anti-behavioral genetics crowd. It does smack of protesting
too much. I am convinced already. One refutation or two is enough for
me, the layman. No amount of refutations will convince the
unconvertable. For them it is about about belief, not science.

One of the more interesting things about science is that it is
not fragile. Science simply says that ideas can be tested. Science
makes no moral judgments. Morals are difficult if you base them on an
externality. Morals are not fragile if you accept you might be wrong
about them. You believe them, because they align with your
experience. You change them when you learn something new which
contradicts your prior experience.

Our choices are affected by anxiety which in turn affects our
choices. Like any system you can choose to use this feedback

of the system.

Choice requires change, that is, to acknowledge the universe is
in flux and we must react at a conscious level to its whims. John
Conway has a mathematical proof of the existence of Free Will by
starting with the non-determinism inherent in quantum theory. At the end
of the proof he says that some people would call this Free Whim, and I
agree with that. It is impossible to define Free Will any other
way. To do so would be to eliminate some freedom in it by constraining
it. It is a bit like the Heisenberg Principle.
