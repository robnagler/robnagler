By Paul Feyerabend, Verso, September 1993, 978-0860916468 

Paul Feyerabend is a contrarian.  If he would have written a review
of Against Method, it would have been For Method.  As a contrarian,
he's a hoot.  He finds contradictions in almost everything.

Feyerabend's philosophy of science is a series of accidents.  His
argument gets quite technical for me, even though the language is
plain.  Perhaps he already assumes the reader is familiar with the
subject.  This book is so full of facts that it became difficult for
me to do anything but trust that they were true, or I would have lost
the flow, entirely.  That being said, his general approach resonates
with me, and my philosophy.

I was confused, in particular, by Feyerabend's methodological (or
simply logical) approach to understanding how Galileo advanced
science.  I find it very hard to know or understand if "no method" is
a method on its own.  I still don't get how falsificationism
(falibilism) isn't useful.  Certainly, I find it useful in testing the
software I create.  It's my method, and I do believe that it's the
most effective method for software development.  Not that it is at all
popular to write software iteratively or test-driven.

It seems that Feyerabend is saying that the method of presentation
that convinces or proves something, and therefore you can't really
prove anything or take anything stated as "fact" for granted.  I'm an
eternal skeptic, except what I've been convinced of, and then I'm as
hardnosed as Feyerabend is about his belief that we should hold fast
to no method.

Being a skeptic, Against Method left me with a lot of questions: How
do we find our own truths?  When do we hold fast on to what we believe
is a truth, and when do we change our mind?  Do we always believe the
presenter, or never?  If not, why not?  Is progress simply a mirage
for society?

I did find Feyerabend to be paternalistic towards primitive peoples.
He wants us to leave them alone, but why shouldn't we communicate with
them, and try to provide Western scientific methods to them and more
important, the useful products of science (e.g. medicine).   Should we
not let them choose if they are interested or not in our
systems/methods/products?  To me that's truly free.

 Do not constrain yourself to an epistemology.  You'll stagnate.
Yet at the same time, do not stray to far from it.

 I agree with Feyeraband that we do not understand intuition.  It
is not intelligence, but a particular type of nimbleness which allows
us to come up with totally new abstractions.

 It is interesting how he corrects himself in this 3rd edition.
I don't believe that reason contradicts anarchy.  To my mind, true
anarchy means that we are reasonable people, and can discuss things.
Anarchy is not nihlism.

 I always find it interesting to see programmers talk about a
particularly elegant program.  First, programmers disagree about even
the most simple example.  Second, it's always in hindsight, and it's
part of the presentation, i.e., what's popular is often more elegant
than what we encounter in our every day code.

 This is a bit confusing to me.  I don't see how he discredits
refutation here (which I believe he's attempting to do).  I read this
as refuting the idea that theories can be "true", which very much
agrees with Popper.

 I find the all caps NO rather odd.  Feyerabend writes so
forcefully, you wouldn't think he'd need to resort to "fear caps".
Is there doubt here?

 Here is a typical attack on Popper (and Lakatos).  Any
methodology, even no methodology, is an attempt at "fiat" in my
opinion.  I particularly don't like Feyerabend's truth-tizzy, which
has nothing to do with Popper (who claims there can never be truth,
only verisimilitude).  I wholeheartedly agree that we are constantly
changing our interpretation of our perceptions and therefore new
conceptions are continually arising.  I think Lakatos made an
important point that it is important we be "fair" when we compare
theories, experiments, discussions, etc.  That means holding multiple
points of view in your head and evaluating and discussing them openly.
This is the most reasonable approach to progress, but we have yet to
achieve that -- I, for one, find it difficult to truly consider other
points of view.

 Feyerabend here demonstrates his black and white tendencies.
Reason probably contributed to the growth of science.  Finding a
counterexample to Feyerabend's claim is probably trivial.  I don't
have one handy, because I think of most scientists are reasoning and
reasonable.

 Why should we not offer information to all cultures?  What does
robbing their ancestors have anything to do with how we communicate
with them today?  What does tradition override anything?  Romanticism
is not a solution to the communication problem we have today.
Romanticism separates people, and often leads to war.

 Slaves were brought by conquering tribes. Do we want tribes to
live "as they see fit?"  How, what, where?  Do we let them have
nuclear weapons, if they see fit?  The strongest survive so were the
Aztecs or Spaniards?  Do we let their leaders abuse their people?  Do
we give the Americas back to the Aztecs and allow them to subjugate
all the other native american tribes?
