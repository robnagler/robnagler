By Susan Burton and Cari Lynn, The New Press, February 12, 2019, 1620974355

Wow. Susan Burton became Ms. Burton on a long hard road. I read
about it, and maybe felt it through the excellent
writing. (Ms. Burton's voice comes through loud and clear.) However,
I can't truly understand what it is like to grow up poor, black,
during 1950s.

Becoming Ms. Burton is a book for the times. It explains why you can't
ignore the path-dependence problem. We all have our histories, and
they are unique to our experience, but the collective history of Black
America is not mine. I was lucky. Susan Burton was extremely unlucky.

Her call to action is visceral. Read the book to understand why we
have to find a solution to the formerly incarcerated people, to
domestic abuse, to sexual abuse, to prejudice, to racism, and to
police brutality.

> oppressive rules, laws, policies, and practices has failed to permanently
> crush one woman's spirit and the spirits of the many women who have
> walked through the doors of A New Way of Life, though surely that system
> has tried.

> [k314] There's also no logical reason why federal prisons offer halfway
> houses to those newly released, but state prisons provide nothing. Four
> thousand newly released women arrive in Los Angeles County every year to
> nothing.

> [k316] You have no house key, no credit card, no checkbook, no driver's
> license, no Social Security card, no identification of any sort because
> anything you were carrying when you were arrested has been destroyed by
> the state.

> [k331] Three days: that's the average time for someone to relapse after
> getting out of prison.

> [k335] The prison guard who put me on the bus waved and said, "We got
> your bed waiting for you. See you soon."

> [k339] People with my color skin, and who grew up where I did, didn't
> know concepts like rehab. I was always remanded to prison.

> [k347] It could have been anyone at the wheel, but it happened to be a
> policeman driving an unmarked van. He didn't see my son. Nor did he stick
> around.

> [k352] When time's numbing effect began to take hold, my rage was
> replaced by a depression so deep I felt hollow.

> [k360] In Los Angeles from 1940 to 1945, the white population rose less
> than 20 percent, while the black population increased nearly 110 percent.
> Yet only 5 percent of the city's residential areas allowed blacks.

> [k382] Mama was beautiful, and she was smart. How determined she must
> have been to get herself all the way to Howard University. She pursued a
> degree in Home Economics, one of the only majors available to women then.

> [k565] At 61st Street Elementary, I placed top in my class spelling
> contest, qualifying me to compete in the schoolwide spelling bee.

> [k615] For those years, I lived in a constant state of fear. I was scared
> of my brothers and scared of my mother and scared of that house.

> [k626] Mama had two sides: the tornado of rage she unleashed on me, and
> the side she presented to everyone else.

> [k625] She hit my thighs until U-shaped welts appeared. Sometimes, my
> skin opened.

> [k634] More than 60 percent of incarcerated women report having been
> sexually assaulted before the age of eighteen.

> [k649] All I could do was silently stand there, burning with humiliation,
> swallowing back my fury. I was trained not to talk back, though this was
> about more than just respecting your elders. This went back to an
> archetypal core: you didn't speak up to the master, no matter what, no
> matter if the master was right or wrong or crazy as a loon, you didn't
> say a damn thing.

> [k653] If only I had understood the threat I posed to Aunt
> Elizabeth--that if Daddy ever found out his sister's role in what had
> happened to me with Curly, there's no telling what he'd have done.
> Looking back, she had to have realized this, and her solution was to
> intimidate, to lord over me.

> [k689] I don't remember how much money Mr. Burke offered to lure me into
> his bedroom. He told me not to be scared, that he wasn't going to hurt
> me. I clenched the bedspread, my body going stiff as a board.

> [k692] I kept returning to his house. I came back for $10, then $20, then
> $50. I taught myself how, the instant I walked through the door, to take
> my mind far away, to a place of silence and stillness.

> [k695] I was ten years old, then eleven, then twelve, and I became
> accustomed to Mr. Burke's money.

> [k700] Around this time, I began to have a noticeable stutter and was
> sent to the speech therapist at school. The therapist, a white woman,
> called in my mother, and I overhead her telling Mama I was going to grow
> up to be a criminal.

> [k719] The principal made me kneel on a bench. The edge of my jumper was
> supposed to graze the bench. Instead, it hovered about an inch too high.
> I was suspended from school for two weeks on account of the inch.

> [k725] By the time I returned to school, I'd fallen considerably behind,
> especially in math.

> [k723] I learned how to get with boys--and that I could pick the boys I
> wanted. I learned to buck authority, and I learned to be defiant.

> [k726] Having always been a good student, I didn't know how to ask for
> help.

> [k727] With each passing week, my confusion and stress mounted. And then
> it occurred to me: there was a way I could solve this. I could decide to
> stop caring about school. I could, instead, go hang out.

> [k769] During World War II, when the availability of defense factory jobs
> prompted thousands of black southerners to head to Los Angeles in search
> of a better life, Watts was one of the only areas blacks were permitted
> to live. Merely two square miles, Watts soon became the most densely
> populated neighborhood in the country

> [k776] By 1965, Watts was boiling over with decades of employment and
> housing discrimination, segregation, extreme poverty, and police abuse.

> [k796] We had the Four Tops on the record player, the volume turned up
> and the front door open so we could hear. Before our eyes, a military
> tank rolled down 41st Street. Out jumped soldiers in combat gear, rifles
> pointed at us. "Get inside!" they ordered. We scrambled into that
> stifling, crumbling house so fast.

> [k875] Now, her shame had become mine. It would be another three decades
> before I'd finally confront my mother, and even after all that time it
> took vast courage to speak honestly to her.

> [k931] If only I'd known that, too often, black girls like me were
> considered dropouts but were really "push-outs"--pushed out of
> opportunities that school should have provided.

> [k934] We had no safety net, no system of support, no community or
> services to turn to and say, dignity intact: "I need some help."

> [k945] Black women comprise 40 percent of street prostitutes, though 55
> percent of women arrested for prostitution are black, and 85 percent of
> women incarcerated for prostitution are black.

> [k961] James secured me an ID that said I was twenty-one years old. And
> he found the johns willing to pay up. I entered into what we in the
> underworld called "the life."

> [k964] My sense of self was so warped that I believed my ability to
> divorce myself from my emotions was my greatest asset.
>
> I set my sights three years ahead, when I would turn eighteen
> and could get Toni without fear of Mama dragging me off to juvenile hall.
> Until then, I'd linger on my corner, no shortage of men who
> wanted to get with me, and make what I convinced myself was an easy
> living.

> [k1010] My first sentence was reduced from thirty days to twenty for good
> behavior. James was waiting to pick me up, and I hopped in his Cadillac
> and went straight back to work.

> [k1046] Other women--white women--might have gone to the police for a
> restraining order. But in my community, the police weren't who we turned
> to for help. To willingly go to the police, you had to believe they were
> on your side.

> [k1334] Often, I thought Toni sounded lonely. But what I didn't know was
> that, in a way, my brothers' and my incarceration lifted a weight from
> her. She'd been shouldering the pressures of her academic life plus
> worrying about all of us, and now she no longer had to feel responsible
> for everyone else in the family. She could replace the shame and
> embarrassment of us with peace, quiet, and normalcy.

> [k1340] I returned to Los Angeles in time for Toni's prom, then her
> graduation. On top of that, she'd earned a scholarship in math to UCLA.
> My daughter was going to a university.

> [k1346] Crack had come to town mysteriously and seemingly overnight.

> [k1359] Webb pointed to a primary kingpin: a Contra enjoying political
> asylum in California. And his biggest customer: a young black man from
> South Central L.A., Ricky Ross.

> [k1368] Suddenly flush with cash, the Crips invested in automatic
> weapons, which were also, conveniently, supplied by the Contras. Soon,

> [k1378] But a Department of Justice Inspector General's report would
> later reveal that, although the whereabouts of Freeway Ricky Ross's major
> Nicaraguan drug supplier were known and tracked, the kingpin wasn't
> arrested.

> [k1392] At first, to me, crack seemed weird and strange, and I didn't
> like it. But in the act of consuming it, my pain was replaced with a
> silence more profound than anything I had ever experienced.

> [k1395] It didn't matter what my mother said, or how my daughter looked
> at me. Crack made nothing else matter.

> [k1398] Because of the crack epidemic and the harsh, racially
> discriminatory policies of the Anti--Drug Abuse Act, one in three black
> men will see the inside of a jail cell. The average time served by
> African Americans for nonviolent drug offenses is virtually the same as
> the time whites serve for violent offenses.

> [k1437] But you couldn't get angry or sad in jail because you had no
> recourse, there was nowhere to put it--you couldn't talk to anyone about
> it, or shout about it, or eat it back, or walk it off, or punch the air.

> [k1458] But we weren't allowed to talk. In chow hall, you opened your
> mouth only to put food into it.

> [k1488] "Fire camp is a privilege," a board member informed me. Indeed,
> this privilege was reserved for those who presented little threat of
> escape if taken off prison grounds. But being sent to the front line to
> fight California wildfires when you wanted to be learning how to do hair
> seemed the opposite of a privilege.

> [k1491] What I didn't know at the time was that, even if an assignment
> to the cosmetology shop had been granted, I still wouldn't have stood a
> chance of working in a beauty shop on the outside. Most professional
> licenses--whether it was beautician, barber, social worker, plumber, the
> list in many states was a hundred job titles long--were denied to people
> with a criminal record.

> [k1510] worked out to be a good system, and by sharing our possessions we
> were rarely without. The money prisoners made at work detail amounted to spare
> change, so in order to buy common necessities at the canteen you needed
> people on the outside to mail a money order to the prison to fill your
> account. One thing I can say for my family, they always pulled together
> when any of the Burtons were incarcerated.

> [k1522] To me, prison was about learning how to navigate and how to
> comply.

> [k1534] Seemed like America had figured out reliable phone service half a
> century earlier, but the prison phone would work some days and not
> others, and no one was ever sure why or how to fix it.
> The spotty service was especially surprising since the private
> company that had the prison phone contract engaged in some serious price
> gouging: all calls were collect, and the recipient was billed $15 for a
> ten-minute, in-state call.

> [k1558] One in every 125 white children has a parent behind bars--for
> African American children, the rate is one in nine.

> [k1628] She was tired of accepting the collect calls, tired of
> planning days around visiting hours. She felt her reward for being
> well behaved and a good student was
> that she had to run around and take care of all the adults who were
> screwing up their lives.

> [k1687] We were dealing with police who, when called to a homicide, would
> walk over the bodies looking for property to take--but under the
> country's seizure and civil forfeiture laws, this was not illegal. Each
> time I was arrested, any money I had on me disappeared. The police said
> the cash was evidence. But none of this "evidence" would be recorded on
> booking slips, none showed up in court documents. This time I was going
> to prison not on evidence the police stole but evidence they planted.

> [k1718] Still under construction at the time was the $140 million Central
> California Women's Facility, which would hold the title of the largest
> women's prison in the world (and which, only a handful of years after
> opening, would be stuffed to double the intended capacity).

> [k1750] Though I can't blame my actions on the drugs, I was high when I
> said my vows. I had no idea what a good man was supposed to be, but Chief
> supported me financially and never raised a hand to me, and that meant
> something.

> [k1758] Dope doesn't exactly compel you to be a kind, considerate person,
> and I treated myself and everyone around me poorly.

> [k1767] I was a sad, lost, broken woman. I was an addict, an alcoholic.
> Not once in those courtrooms did it go down differently. Not once did a
> judge say, "Let's defer her to treatment." I didn't know to ask for
> anything different--treatment wasn't something offered up to people from
> my community.

> [k1803] Public pretenders, that's what we called them on the inside. No
> more useful in court than your own shadow standing next to you.

> [k1807] Bright-eyed intentions were useless when the public defenders'
> office was so severely underfunded it was practically impossible for a
> lawyer to spend more than five minutes per case.
> It was the prosecutors who now ran the courtroom; public
> defenders and, for that matter, judges were virtually powerless.

> [k1821] This time, supplied with information from my bunkie, I decided I
> would be the bargainer. I told my lawyer, "I will take the plea of five
> years if I am sent to the Civil Addict Program."

> [k1824] From the moment I had entered the system, I was flagged for the
> criminal side, while my white bunkie was flagged for the civil side, even
> though our crimes were the same.

> [k1827] California Rehabilitation Center, located in Norco, about an hour
> from Los Angeles, was still a state penitentiary with barbed wire
> surrounding the premises, but the interior felt slightly more welcoming.

> [k1831] The first obvious thing I noticed about my fellow prisoners was
> that they were predominantly white. Soon, other things became clear: most
> hailed from suburban areas of California, and most had been represented
> by private attorneys, not public defenders. No wonder I hadn't been
> offered CRC before.

> [k1839] Though the prison was called a rehabilitation center, CCEP wasn't
> drug rehab. It didn't include therapy, there were no group discussions,
> no counseling, it didn't delve into anything personal. Our teacher was a
> former prison guard, not a therapist. We were assigned a textbook and
> watched stilted educational movies about addiction.

> [k1874] Also, my mother had grown oddly passive and distracted--what we'd
> later learn was the early stages of Alzheimer's. "I'd wanted to do
> everything differently," Toni later told me. "But how could I when I was
> still there?"
>
> As a mother, Toni was beyond strict, and I knew her biggest
> fear was that Ellesse would stray down a bad path, like the rest of us.

> [k1885] I passed the written CCEP test, then went before the board for
> the verbal test. Right on schedule, I was released, having served eight
> months.

> [k1950] Once again, I memorized the lessons in the textbook and watched
> the same slides and stilted movies. And, just as before, old wounds were
> prodded. But, this time, something unsettling happened: I couldn't
> automatically shut myself down. When one of the movies described
> dysfunctional family roles, such as the perpetual caregiver or the
> scapegoat, something in me began to stir. At night, as I tried to fall
> asleep, scenes of my childhood flashed before my eyes. I thought I'd
> buried these memories too deep to unearth, but the images continued to
> grow more and more vivid. As the months went on, emotions that I didn't
> want to feel flooded me. I was hurting like hell and had no idea what to
> do about it.

> [k1966] I told her about the rape and my pregnancy. I told her about K.K.
>
> Ms. Tucker looked at me for a long moment. I feared she was
> going to tell me I was out of line. She said, "I don't want you to worry
> about passing my class. You have enough to think about."

> [k1970] This was an official indication that things had gone very wrong
> in my life. Her validation caused me, for the first time, to cry my heart
> out.

> [k2016] "Susan, you never learned." She shook her head. "You just cross
> your legs, and you lock them. That's what I always did." She then paused
> from her quilting, as though exasperated. "Look, I could not help you as
> a little girl, and I cannot help you now. Why don't you just go away?"

> [k2013] "Mama, about Mr. Burke," I said. "I was just a little girl." Her
> face hardened. "Don't try to run no guilt trip on me, Susan. You did what
> you did." "But, Mama, it was illegal. Why did you keep letting that
> happen?" "Susan, you never learned." She shook her head. "You just cross
> your legs, and you lock them. That's what I always did." She then paused
> from her quilting, as though exasperated. "Look, I could not help you as
> a little girl, and I cannot help you now. Why don't you just go away?"
>
> I went out back, the abused little girl now a mangled, broken woman.

> [k2050] Black women are more than twice as likely to be incarcerated for
> drug offenses as white women.

> [k2074] One of the men shared that he was here because he'd been driving
> drunk and hit a police car. In my neighborhood, that'd be called
> attempted murder. But this man, white, living in Santa Monica, was
> sentenced to community service, which entailed painting a jail.

> [k2077] I listened silently, thinking about my brother, Michael, who'd
> been sentenced to eight years in prison for falling asleep at the
> wheel--with no alcohol or drug involvement--and he still had to serve the
> full sentence even after being diagnosed with narcolepsy.

> [k2084] In that room, I found hope. Someone passed me a newcomer chip.
> Someone else gave me the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. On the walk
> back after the meeting, I held both close to my heart.

> [k2089] I learned how to meditate, and to not be afraid of being alone
> with myself.

> [k2091] Every morning we gathered for readings and discussion and to set
> an individual goal for the day. It was the first time in my life I'd
> deliberately set a goal.

> [k2361] Ms. Andrews was a sweet lady, and I bathed her, did her laundry,
> cleaned the house, grocery shopped, cooked, and picked up her
> prescriptions.

> [k2365] I saw firsthand how poorly most seniors are treated--how lonely
> and scary it is to grow frail, and how ill equipped we are as a society
> to provide care.

> [k2377] She and her friends continued referring me, and before long, I
> was caring for seven clients, visiting different homes on alternating
> days of the week.

> [k2405] He asked about my background, and I stumbled through some
> answers, which prompted him to ask if I'd ever had a felony conviction.
> "Yes," I said. He put down his pen. "You are not eligible to take nursing
> courses," he said. "You can't be licensed as an RN or certified as a home
> health aide with a criminal record."

> [k2445] We decided A New Way of Life was exactly right. Ms. Andrews and I
> said a sad goodbye and, as she moved out of her home, I moved into mine.
> It was 1998, and I had no idea I was on the brink of something that would
> become larger and more meaningful than I could ever have imagined.

> [k2455] Stan was, himself, formerly homeless. A black man from Chicago,

> [k2511] In some small way, I hoped my presence and my voice could offer
> women a way out of the cycle, could help them find their own lasting
> freedom.

> [k2559] In the evening, Mitzi cooked dinner, and we all ate together,

> [k2721] "In this country, there's a public policy commitment to

> problems. "What does it mean that the number-one funder for political

> [k2847] Saul passed around to our study group a sheet with

> [k3182] It cost up to $75,000 to incarcerate a woman for one year--but,
> after her release, zero was invested in reuniting her with her children
> and providing support for the family.

> [k4138] But when Vonya went to collect the completed forms, there were
> only five, and they were all marked Republican. Out of four thousand
> inmates in a largely Latino city, this seemed odd. She requested that All

> [k4467] Unarmed blacks are killed by the police at five times the rate of
