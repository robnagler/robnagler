By James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras, HarperBusiness, 1997, 0-88730-739-6
 My first Jim Collins book.  I think of it as a Jim Collins
book although Jerry Porras is probably as much a contributor as
Collins was.  It's just that all Collins' books have the same theme:
trial and error works.  While some people may read his "core values"
talk as "stay the course".  I disagree.  I think it means: believe in
yourself, and you'll be successful at whatever you do.
