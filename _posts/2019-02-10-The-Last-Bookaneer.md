By Matthew Pearl, Penguin Press, April 28, 2015, 1594204926

Matthew Pearl continues to delight me by interweaving history and
fiction so expertly that I look up the facts he presents to see if
they are true or not. For example, he says someone telegrams from
Samoa in the 1890's. Yes, [even before 1890](http://n99.us/axt).

The book is very readable, but it is long (400 pages). It gets dry in
some spots, but it's necessary due to the complexity of the history.

The premise of the book is that during the 1800's publishers were
arbitraging copyright law by paying bookaneers (agents) to get
manuscripts and publish them in other countries. Pearl creates a
hierarchy of the bookaneer's from "barnacles" to the elite. The book
is about a couple of elite who are trying to get a copy of Robert
Louis Stevenson's soon-to-be-finished novel. Stevenson resides in
Samoa (true), and the bookaneers ventures to Samoa and after are
covered. It's told as a retelling by a bookseller and further recorded
by a young man enraptured by the story. Very clever.

> [k2197] "He is a friend?" "Publishers do not have friends."

NOTE: It's odd that Pearl characterizes publishers being the enemy of
the authors when he so strongly sides with publishing interests.

> [k3673] In fact, I would have been happy to see the copies

NOTE: The emphasis on piracy is interesting. It seems to be where the
author's sentiments lie, and it's a strong theme in the book that
people who steal intellectual propery are pirates.

NOTE: When asked what I do, I often say the same that am a programmer,
or in technical communities, a hacker.

> concoct a complicated bundle of charges tied with the new treaty to

> larceny against the publishing firm. Copyright was just the
> beginning. The case of New York v. Lott would herald the start of

> [k4878] "'I write two or three novels at a time, Fergins, with two
> or three more in mind at all times. They come cheaply, and you must
> serenade them while writing, but all novels are disappointments as

> I've just finished? Why, I've burned far better books that that.' "

> [k4958] People hate the idea of politicians, you see, but love the
> idea of authors, at least until they meet one.

> [k5129] Call me quixotic, but this will revolutionize the literary
> inheritance we leave behind. These islands will be the New World for

NOTE: I find this grandiose. There were a few places like this that
might have been better to be left out although it does add to
ending. There was a mention of a stonehenge-like structure at one
point, which is annoying.

# The Story Behind the _Last Bookaneer_

> [k5191] Still, Stevenson, like all popular authors of his day, was
> affected by literary piracy throughout his career, and was keenly
> aware of that. "I have lost a great deal of money through the piracy
> of my works in America," he wrote, "and should consider it quite
> fair to use any means to defeat the lower class of American
> publishers, who calmly appropriate one's works as soon as they are
> issued."

> [k5205] As far as historical fiction goes, it fit one of my ideals:
> a bit of gray-area history that cannot be explored very far without
> the help of fiction. In this

> [k5207] I applied the term bookaneer, one I had noticed had been
> used in a generic sense in the nineteenth century about literary
> piracy (the earliest use I find is in 1837 by poet Thomas Hood).
