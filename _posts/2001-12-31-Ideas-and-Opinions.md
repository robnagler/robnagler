By Albert Einstein, Crown Publishers Inc., 1985, 0-517-55601-4
 Einstein was not only brilliant, he was a great man.
There are some great, and very readable essays in this book.


> [p4] The cult of individuals is always, in my view, unjustified.  To
> be sure, nature distributes her gifts unevenly among her children.



> [p10] Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathesome
> nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I
> hate them!



> [p14] The health of society thus depends quite as much on the
> independence of the individuals composing it as on their close social
> cohesion.



> [p22] Man has an intense desire for assured knowledge.



> [p57] Incidentally I'm only coming to Princeton to do research, not to
> teach.  There is too much education altogether, especially in American
> schools.  The only rational way of educating is to be an example -- if
> one can't help it, a warning example.
