 Adams is brilliant.  This book contains many of his
non-fiction essays and a novella called The Salmon of Doubt.


> [p. xxiii] he treated writing as a performance art [and] he needs
> an audience to bounce things off.



> [p92] And now we have the World Wide Web (the only thing I know of
> whose shortened form--www--takes three times longer to say in what it's
> short for).



> [p115] We are stuck with technology when what we really want is
> just stuff that works.  How do you recognize something that is still
> technology?  A good clue is if it comes with a manual.



> [p124] Whatever complexities a computer produces--modeling wind
> turbulence, modeling economies or the way light dances in the eye of
> an imaginary dinosaur--it all grows out of simple lines of code that
> start with adding one and one, testing the result, and then doing it
> again.
