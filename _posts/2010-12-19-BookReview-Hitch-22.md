Christopher Hitchens is a polymath.  There's simply no doubt about
it.  I think that's why his autobiography is not all that
fascinating.  It's full of pithy and revealing quotes, but it is both
self-congratulating and self-flagellating at the same time.  I stopped
reading it midway through.

> [k221] Janus was the name given by the Romans to the tutelary deity

> of his temples were kept open in time of war, the time in which the
> ideas of contradiction and conflict are most naturally regnant. The
> most intense wars are civil wars, just as the most vivid and rending
> personal conflicts are internal ones, and what I hope to do now is

> to show two faces at the same time.
