The title is clever but a bit misleading. The book starts off about
about suicide (dysfunction of self), then on to a story about an
reformed enforcer for the mob (deluded himself), and many other
stories about history and people. It's fascinating stuff. Storr is a
great science writer.

I walked away with a better understanding of how the self came about
in evolutionary terms. It fits in with a lot of other psychology I've
read.

Will Storr was interviewed by David McRaney's multiple times. This
book was the topic of
[You Are Not So Smart #127: How we became self obsessed](http://n99.us/ueu).

> [k131] Today, over a twelve-month period, between 8 and 10 per cent
> of the entire adult population of the US and UK uses
> antidepressants. There exists the strong possibility that our
> suicide statistics might look considerably worse if the millions
> suffering from serious psychological maladies hadn't been offered
> this help. And those statistics are pretty dire already. Today more
> people die by suicide than in all the wars, terrorist attacks,
> murders and government executions combined. According to the World
> Health Organisation, in 2012, 11.4 people out of every 100,000 died
> by self-harm versus 8.8 people as a result of interpersonal
> violence, collective violence and legal intervention.

> [k163] If you're prone to social perfectionism, your self-esteem
> will be dangerously dependent on keeping the roles and
> responsibilities you believe you have.

> [k189] Another risky trait he admits to suffering is brooding
> rumination -- continual thoughts about thoughts.

> [k198] The self then blames itself for these failures, and loses
> faith in its ability to repair what's gone wrong. 'We believe it's a
> feeling of being defeated and humiliated from which you cannot
> escape,' said Rory.

> [k207] One of the most critical functions of the human self is to
> make us feel in control of our lives. When people are having
> perfectionistic thoughts, they're wanting to feel that they're in
> control of their mission of being the great person they imagine they
> ought to be.

> [k225] Since the emergence of social media, the incidence of eating
> disorders and body dysmorphia in the US and the UK has risen by
> around 30 per cent.

> [k246] All of us, male and female, are apparently feeling increasing
> pressure to be perfect.

> [k352] So there's self and then there's culture. Two separate
> things. It's the self that wants to become perfect, and it's our
> culture that tells it what 'perfect' actually is.

> [k533] Children start attempting to manage their reputations at
> around the age of five. Of course, in our hunter-gatherer days, it
> was critically important that we maintained a good reputation. Those
> who earned bad ones could easily be beaten, killed or ostracized --
> which would, in that environment, have been a likely death
> sentence. And still today, a core activity of the human self is
> maintaining a deep interest in, and trying to control, what others
> think of us.

> [k590] What we're doing is trying to control the selfishness of
> others, thereby maintaining the smooth running of the tribe.

> [k596] Remember those toddlers who just naturally expected members
> of their group to share with each other? They weren't surprised that
> a person would refuse to share with someone from a different
> group. Selfless acts are most often made on behalf of our people.

> [k605] Because of our tribal roots, all humans share the basic
> principle that a good person is selfless.

> [k617] As anyone who's suffered from painful perfectionistic
> thinking can testify, we don't only crave a good reputation amongst
> others, we also crave it with ourselves.

> [k691] To begin to understand what happened to John, we need to
> consider just one facet of what psychologists and neuroscientists
> mean when they talk about this idea of the self as a 'story'. Doing
> so reveals something important and disturbing about the human self:
> that it is built to tell us a story of who we are, and that that
> story is a lie.

> [k735] The discomforting truth is that we all have interpreters
> narrating our lives, and they're all just guessing. We all
> confabulate, all the time.

> [k747] 'When we set out to explain our actions, they are all
> post-hoc explanations using post-hoc observations with no access to
> nonconscious processing,' writes Gazzaniga. Any inconvenient facts
> that don't fit with the interpreter's story are ignored or
> suppressed. 'That "you" that you're so proud of is a story woven
> together by your interpreter module to account for as much of your
> behaviour as it can incorporate, and it denies and rationalizes the
> rest.' All this means that 'listening to people's explanations for
> their actions is interesting but often a waste of time.'

> [k766] For the person struggling with perfectionist thinking, of
> course, that voice can sometimes be more enemy than friend: you're
> feeling anxious and sad because you're not good enough, you're a
> failure, you're a prick, you're fat and ugly and you always will be.

> [k1530] In order to be happy, then, we really ought to be living our
> lives as story. We should have a goal and feel like we're at least
> somewhat successful in our pursuit of it. Suicide is what happens
> when the progress halts, robbing us of our hero status.

> [k1709] From what we know now about the left-brain interpreter we
> can wonder if the play acted as a kind of ready made confabulation
> for Sigi, a makes-sense story that fitted so perfectly over the
> traumatic, shameful muddle that happened to exist in his head, and
> made him feel better about it. As historian Professor Peter
> Rudnytsky has observed, 'The coincidence between his biographical
> accidents of birth and the Oedipus drama is staggering.' And as the
> man himself was to write, 'I have found love of the mother and
> jealousy of the father in my own case too, and now believe it to be
> a general phenomenon of early childhood ... If that is the case, the
> gripping power of Oedipus Rex ... becomes intelligible.'

> [k1860] Adherents of what psychologist William James termed 'the
> mind-cure movement' thought similarly. James defined mind-cure as
> the 'intuitive belief in the all-saving power of healthy-minded
> attitudes'. Mind-cure's forefather was a clockmaker from New England
> named Phineas Quimby who'd become fascinated by 'magnetic healers'
> who claimed to have access to quasi-magical powers. But Quimby
> decided that, actually, their patients only felt better because they
> believed in the authority of the healer. 'The cure is not in the
> medicine,' he wrote, 'but in the confidence of the doctor or
> medium.' He began testing his ideas on the unwell. Writes Mitch
> Horowitz, 'Quimby's method was to sympathetically sit face-to-face
> with a patient, never denying that the subject was sick but rather
> encouraging him to "understand how disease originates in the mind
> and to fully believe it." If the patient's confidence in this idea
> was complete, Quimby would then urge the patient to ask: "Why cannot
> I cure myself?"' In 1862 Quimby treated Mary Baker Eddy, who went on
> to found the Christian Science movement, which located the source of
> all sickness and misery in the mind. Twenty-six years later, a
> British-born suffragette named Frances Lord, who'd become entranced
> with the Christian Science scene on a visit to the US, published
> what Horowitz describes as 'the prosperity gospel'.

> [k2147] What Carl Rogers and the intronauts of Esalen couldn't know
> is that many of today's experts claim there is no authentic
> self. Rather than there being a pure and godlike centre to us all,
> we actually contain a collection of bickering and competing selves,
> some of whom, as we'll see, are quite disgusting. Different versions
> of 'us' become dominant in different environments. It's now often
> claimed the human self cannot be reduced to some 'innermost
> core'. The 'I' is not one, it is many.

> [k2156] 'At its very simplest, a self is a way that we can make
> sense of the things that happen to us,' he told me, leaning back in
> his chair with his legs crossed out in front of him. 'You need to
> have a sense of self in order to organize your life events into a
> meaningful story.'

> [k2181] Our lack of true authenticity means that who we are and how
> we behave tends to shift, somewhat, depending on where we are and
> who we're with.

> [k2229] The study didn't only suggest we have radically different
> moral codes depending on our shifting states of self. More
> unsettlingly, it showed how poor we can be at predicting our own
> behaviour. We're not one person, then, but many, and the people we
> are can be strangers to each other.

> [k2237] What all this work suggests is that a foundational idea of
> the Humanistic Psychologists is simply wrong -- there is no
> authentic core to us, no essential, happy and perfect version of the
> self that can be exposed by stripping back the repressing
> expectations of society.

> [k2320] The problem with all this, I've found, is that the more you
> choose to be alone, the more everyone else wants to leave you
> alone. Isolation makes you paranoid.

> [k2348] neurotic perfectionism. We're those worried and anxious
> people who have a 'massive discrepancy' between who we are and who
> we need to be. We make these sweeping generalizations, about
> ourselves, so if we're not efficient at a particular thing, it's a
> failure of the entire self. And with this comes a lot of
> self-loathing.

> [k3592] Following the self-esteem revolution, parents and teachers
> increasingly sought to protect children's esteem by artificially
> cocooning them from natural consequences. One manifestation of this
> is the grade inflation that's been reported in educational
> institutions in America and Britain. Between 1968 and 2004, SAT
> scores for college applicants in US schools fell -- and yet the
> proportion of college freshmen claiming an A average in high school
> still somehow managed to rise from 18 per cent to 48 per cent.

> [k3933] Every third photograph taken by an eighteen-to
> twenty-four-year-old was of themselves. 'You' had arrived.

> [k5154] On the contrary, what it actually leads us towards is a
> better way of finding happiness. The first step is to stop believing
> the tribal propaganda. Once you realize that it's all just an act of
> coercion, that it's your culture trying to turn you into someone you
> can't really be, you can begin to free yourself from its demands.

> [k5164] Stopping the war of perfection that's happening in your head
> is just the first step. Once you've quit trying to be who you're
> not, you can make an assessment of the things you're doing with your
> life. Professor Little, in his study of 'personal projects', argues
> that it's crucial to understand our limitations so that we can
> pursue goals that recognize them.

> [k5182] All we ever wanted was the illusion of control. But we have
> none, not really. And neither do the people around us who seem so
> intimidating in all their radiant perfection.
