Crucial Conversations happen constantly in my house. This book has already
helped me. I first read the book in 2014. I reread it now at the
prompting of a friend, and it was worth it. In conjunction with reading
[Difficult Conversations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-19-Difficult-Conversations %})
and [Thanks for the feedback]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-02-Thanks-for-the-Feedback %}), 
I feel motivated to really work on my behavior. As all these books
note: I'm the only one who I can change. Sometimes I forget that!

The book is very well written, honed by years of experience and two
editions. I didn't visit the website, which contains videos and other
articles.

> [k250] Crucial Conversation - n. A discussion between two or more
> people where (1) stakes are high, (2) opinions vary, and (3)
> emotions run strong.

> [k265] When conversations matter the most--that is, when conversations
> move from casual to crucial--we're generally on our worst behavior.

> [k268] Countless generations of genetic shaping drive humans to handle
> crucial conversations with flying fists and fleet feet, not intelligent
> persuasion and gentle attentiveness.

> [k274] As a result, you end up facing challenging conversations with the
> same intellectual equipment available to a rhesus monkey. Your body is
> preparing to deal with an attacking saber-toothed tiger, not your boss,
> neighbor, or loved ones.

> [k284] You're making this up as you go along because you haven't often
> seen real-life models of effective communication skills.

> [k336] Twenty years of research involving more than 100,000 people
> reveals that the key skill of effective leaders, teammates, parents, and
> loved ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and
> politically risky issues. Period.

> [k367] So we studied over 2,200 projects and programs that had been
> rolled out at hundreds of organizations worldwide. The findings were
> stunning. You can predict with nearly 90 percent accuracy which projects
> will fail--months or years in advance. And now back to our premise. The
> predictor of success or failure was whether people could hold five
> specific crucial conversations.

> [k390] That's because the real problem never was in the process, system,
> or structure--it was in employee _behavior_. The key to real change lies
> not in implementing a new process, but in getting people to hold one
> another accountable to the process. And that requires Crucial
> Conversations skills.

> [k394] The path to high productivity passes not through a static
> system, but through face-to-face conversations.

> [k405] In truth, everyone argues about important issues. But not everyone
> splits up. It's how you argue that matters.

> [k430] We could go on for pages about how the ability to hold crucial
> conversations has an impact on your personal health.

> [k485] The mistake most of us make in our crucial conversations is we
> believe that we have to choose between telling the truth and keeping a
> friend.

> [k502] When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional
> conversations, skilled people find a way to get all relevant information
> (from themselves and others) out into the open.

> [k517] People who are skilled at dialogue do their best to make it safe
> for everyone to add their meaning to the shared pool--even ideas that at
> first glance appear controversial, wrong, or at odds with their own
> beliefs.

> [k522] And even though many people may be involved in a choice, when
> people openly and freely share ideas, the increased time investment is
> more than offset by the quality of the decision.

> [k527] In fact, why is it that nearly 200,000 hospital deaths in the
> United States each year stem from human error? In part because many
> health-care professionals are afraid to speak their minds.

> [k538] Not only does a shared pool help individuals make better choices,
> but since the meaning is shared, people willingly act on whatever
> decisions they make--with both unity and conviction.

> [k623] If you can't get yourself right, you'll have a hard time getting
> dialogue right.

> [k641] And that's the first problem we face in our crucial conversations.
> Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It's that our motives
> do--a fact that we usually miss.

> [k689] Winning. This particular dialogue killer sits at the top of many
> of our lists.

> [k701] Punishing. Sometimes, as our anger increases, we move from wanting
> to win the point to wanting to harm the other person.

> [k706] Keeping the peace.

> [k708] Rather than add to the pool of meaning, and possibly make
> waves along the way, we go to silence.

> [k788] That's why those who are skilled at crucial conversations present
> their brain with a more complex question. They routinely ask: "What do I
> want for myself, the other person, and the relationship?"

> [k797] The best at dialogue refuse Fool's Choices by setting up new
> choices.

> [k799] First, clarify what you really want.

> [k802] Second, clarify what you really don't want.

> [k806] Third, present your brain with a more complex problem. Finally,
> combine the two into an and question that forces you to search for more
> creative and productive options than silence and violence.

> [k1015] You have to become a vigilant self-monitor.

> [k1017] necessary. Specifically, watch to see if you're having a good
> or bad impact on safety.

> [k1115] To break from this insidious cycle, Learn to Look.

> * Learn to look at content and conditions.
> * Look for when things become crucial.
> * Learn to watch for safety problems.
> * Look to see if others are moving toward silence or violence.
> * Look for outbreaks of your Style Under Stress.

> [k1186] To succeed in crucial conversations, we must really care about
> the interests of others--not just our own. The purpose has to be truly
> mutual.

> [k1204] Mutual Respect is the continuance condition of dialogue. As
> people perceive that others don't respect them, the conversation
> immediately becomes unsafe and dialogue comes to a screeching halt.

> [k1225] In essence, feelings of disrespect often come when we dwell on
> how others are different from ourselves. We can counteract these feelings
> by looking for ways we are similar.

> [k1289] Contrasting is a don't/do statement that:
>
> * Addresses > others' concerns that you don't respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (the don't part).
> * Confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (the do part).
>
> For example:
> 
> [The don't part] "The last thing I wanted to do was communicate that I don't value the work you put in or that I didn't want to share it with the VP.
>
> [The do part] I think your work has been nothing short of spectacular."

> [k1321] Contrasting is not apologizing.

> [k1408] But you're not always so lucky. For example, you find out that
> your genuine wants and goals cannot be served except at the expense of
> the other person's. In this case you cannot discover a Mutual Purpose.
> That means you'll have to actively invent one.

> [k1422] In summary, when you sense that you and others are working at
> cross-purposes, here's what you can do. First, step out of the content of
> the conflict.

> [k1424] Commit to seek Mutual Purpose. Make a unilateral public
> commitment to stay in the conversation until you come up with something
> that serves everyone.

> [k1427] Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. Ask people why they
> want what they're pushing for. Separate what they're demanding from the
> purpose it serves.

> [k1431] Invent a Mutual Purpose. If after clarifying everyone's purposes
> you are still at odds, see if you can invent a higher or longer-term
> purpose that is more motivating than the ones that keep you in conflict.

> [k1436] Brainstorm new strategies. With a clear Mutual Purpose, you can
> join forces in searching for a solution that serves everyone.

> [k1606] We observe, we tell a story, and then we feel.  Although
> this addition complicates the model a bit, it also gives us hope.
> Since we and only we are telling the story, we can take back control
> of our own emotions by telling a different story.

> [k1611] _Nothing in this world is good or bad, but thinking makes it so._
> --WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
>
> _Stories provide our rationale for what's going on._

> [k1640] If you want improved results from your crucial conversations,
> change the stories you tell yourself--even while you're in the middle of
> the fray.

> [k1671] Individuals say they're angry when, in fact, they're feeling a
> mix of embarrassment and surprise.

> [k1679] It's important to get in touch with your feelings, and to do so,
> you may want to expand your emotional vocabulary.

> [k1695] Separate fact from story by focusing on behavior. To separate
> fact from story, get back to the genuine source of your feelings.

> [k1700] Spot the story by watching for "hot" words.

> [k1719] The first of the clever stories is a Victim Story.

> [k1723] Within most crucial conversations, when you tell a Victim Story,
> you intentionally ignore the role you have played in the problem.

> [k1731] Villain Stories--"It's All Your Fault" We create these nasty
> little tales by turning normal, decent human beings into villains.

> [k1748] Finally come Helpless Stories. In these fabrications we make
> ourselves out to be powerless to do anything healthy or helpful.

> [k1802] Once we've learned to recognize the clever stories we tell
> ourselves, we can move to the final Master My Stories skill.

> [k1805] Clever stories omit crucial information about us, about others,
> and about our options.

> [k2243] When you have a tough message to share, or when you are so
> convinced of your own rightness that you may push too hard, remember to
> STATE your path:
>
> * Share your facts. Start with the least  controversial, most persuasive elements from your Path to Action.
>
> * Tell your story. Explain what you're beginning to conclude. 
>
> * Ask for others' paths. Encourage others to share both their facts and their stories. 
>
> * Talk tentatively. State your story as a story--don't disguise it as a fact. 
>
> * Encourage testing. Make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views.

> [k2286] This means that at the very moment when most people become
> furious, we need to become curious.

> [k2353] We call the four skills power listening tools because they are
> best remembered with the acronym AMPP--Ask, Mirror, Paraphrase, and
> Prime.

> [k2375] It is not the fact that we are acknowledging others' emotions
> that creates safety. We create safety when our tone of voice says we're
> okay with them feeling the way they're feeling.

> [k2547] For example, when teams or families meet and generate a host of
> ideas, they often fail to convert the ideas into action for two reasons:
>
> * They have unclear expectations about how decisions will be made. 
>
> * They do a poor job of acting on the decisions they do make.

> [k2681] Decide How to Decide
> * _Command_. Decisions are made without involving others.
> * _Consult_. Input is gathered from the group and then a subset decides.
> * _Vote_. An agreed-upon percentage swings the decision.
> * _Consensus_. Everyone comes to an agreement and then supports the final decision.

> [k2739] When spouses stop giving each other helpful feedback, they lose
> out on the help of a lifelong confidant and coach. They miss out on
> hundreds of opportunities to help each other communicate more
> effectively.

> [k2997] Perhaps the most common way that the language of dialogue finds
> itself into everyday conversation is with the expression, "I think we've
> moved away from dialogue."
