 The book is pretty good at explaining OBM in the context of real
companies, but it's like XP books, they all sound alike after a while.
It's not like the theory is complex.  You just have to do it.

The case studies in the book aren't case studies.  They are collection
of annecdotes.  Nice ones, but there are no statistics.  This was
probably the most disappointing part of the book, because the focus of
OBM is numbers, and Case points that out over and over, yet his book
is sorely lacking in numbers about the OBM experience.
