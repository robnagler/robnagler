Barry Eisler's books are fun. John Rain is a great character. The
Japanese scenes make me want to go to Japan and discover the back
alleys and restaurants, Rain loves to talk about. 

It is a bit odd having an assassin as a protaganist, but it's
fiction. The details of his plans are interesting if gruesome at
times. Perhaps this is my Walter Mitty life. I don't think too hard
about the novels, though, and I don't day dream about being an
assassin.
