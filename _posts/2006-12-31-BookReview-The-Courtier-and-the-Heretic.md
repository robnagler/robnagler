Leibniz is the courtier and strong believer in God and the church.
He wants to reunite the two churches (Protestants and Catholics) to go
back to a world where everybody gets along.  He is a child of the
Thirty Years War.

Spinoza is the heretic.  He is a logician that comes to realize that
God is everything, that is, all substance.  Therefore, God is neither
good nor evil; he just is.  Everything comes from God.

Although Leibniz publicly despise Spinoza, he corresponds secretly
with Spinoza and ulimately visits Spinoza in 1676.  There no direct
record of the meeting, but Stewart goes on to show that Leibniz was
greatly affected by the meeting.  Leibniz's philosphy became
more stridently anti-Spinoza, and he struggled with the idea that God
was not the good-and-evil God presented by the church.

While Spinoza never lost faith in the concept in God, Stewart
supposes that Leibniz saw that if God didn't exist as the
good-and-evil God, then the church was founded on a great fallacy.
And, being the ever-inventing scientist, he perhaps believed that if
God was everywhere, he might be nowhere.  That is, nature is simply a
set of arbitrary laws that have nothing to do with morals or God.
Nature simply is.

In the 17th century, "no one" was an out and out atheist, and
neither was Spinoza although they called him the "atheist Jew".
The philosophical community derided Spinoza as "our Jew".  Spinoza,
although regarded as one of the most "devout" philosophers, was never
accepted in the community as a whole.  Leibniz was no different, yet
he always regarded Spinoza with respect, even in his most negative
writings.  This subtlety is what leads Stewart to believe that Leibniz
was unable to forget their meeting, and that Leibniz had this internal
struggle with the concept of God.


> [p56] Equally futile, [Spinoza] reasons, is the craving for fame
> that dominates so many lives: "Honor has this great disadvantage,
> that to pursue it, we must direct our lives according to other men's
> power of understanding."  As for money: "There are many examples of
> men who have suffered persecution even to death for the sake of
> their riches."



> [p57] In his early treatise, Spinoza articulates a further, final
> element of the archetypal philosophical project: that the life of
> contemplation is also a life within a certain type of
> community-specifically, a fellowship of the mind. Like Socrates with
> his circle of debating partners, or Epicurus in his garden with his
> intellectual companions, Spinoza imagines a philosophical future in
> which he and other individuals of reason nourish their wisdom
> through ongoing, mutually enlightening dialogue. In fact, upon
> achieving blessedness for himself, he announces in his first
> treatise, his first step will be "to form a society of the kind that
> is desirable, so that as many as possible may attain it as easily
> and as surely as possible." For, "the highest good," he claims, is
> to achieve salvation together with other individuals "if possible."



> [p58] Even as one consecrates one's life to the pursuit of
> continuous, supreme, and everlasting happiness, of course, as Spinoza
> himself points out, "it is necessary to live." He therefore rounds
> out the introductory sections of his Treatise on the Emendation of
> the Intellect with three proposed "rules of living," intended to
> serve as a practical guide to life for himself and his fellow
> philosophers. The first rule of living is, in brief, to get along
> with the rest of humanity. That is, fellow seekers should follow the
> accepted social customs. and behave amicably with ordinary people and
> otherwise avoid trouble that might jeopardize the overriding mission
> of attaining philosophical blessedness. The second rule is that one
> should enjoy sensual pleasures to the extent that they are required
> to safeguard health and thereby serve the all-important end of
> leading a life of the mind. The third rule is that one should seek
> money and other worldly goods just so far as is necessary to maintain
> life and health-again, for the purpose of maintaining a vigorous
> mind.



> [p65] The apparent tension between the Heraclitean and Epicurean sides
> of Spinoza's character is one that has trailed philosophers since
> ancient times. On the one hand, philosophy by its nature seems to be
> an essentially solitary activity. It is the individual's lonely voyage
> of discovery through the eternal truths of the cosmos-a journey that
> would seem to place the seeker at ever greater removes of knowledge
> and abstraction fiom the rest of humankind. On the other hand, in
> practice, philosophy is a very social activity. It involves dialogues,
> debates, competition for recognition, and the dissemination of wisdom
> to the ever needy human race.



> [p76] Leibniz wanted very badly to do good. He turned to philosophy
> not in order to solve an essentially personal problem-as Spinoza, for
> example, did-but rather in order to solve other people's problems. He
> measured his results not in terms of his own salvation but rather by
> the general happiness of the human race. Philosophy for him was not a
> way of being but one of many instruments to be used in service of the
> general good. The maxim that guided him throughout his long and
> colorfullife-and that he later made the explicit foundation of his
> entire system of philosophy-was "Justice is the charity of the wise."
> His vaulting ambition was to unite in his own practice the virtues of
> wisdom,justice, and charity. And if, as was inevitable in the course
> of such a long and productive life, he seemed to fall short of his
> ideal at times, it should always be remembered just how high he had
> set the bar for himself.



> [p78] In his quest for intellectual peace, Leibniz always insisted
> on the virtue of clarity.  If philosophers would only write clearly,
> he declared--no dbout speaking for generations of exasperated
> students--they would stop fighting one another.  Thus Leibniz
> inaugurated one of the leitmotifS of his mature "philosophy of
> philosophy." In The Art of Combinations, an academic paper he produced
> before he turned tWenty, the brilliant young scholar first mooted the
> idea of a universal characteristic-a language of logical symbols so
> transparent that it would reduce all philosophical disputes to the
> mechanical manipulation of tokens. With possibly eerie prescience
> about the future of information technology, he envisioned encoding
> this logical language in an "arithmetical machine" that could end
> philosophical debates with the push of a button. In the future, he
> rhapsodized, philosophers reaching a point of disagreement will shout
> joyously, "Let's calculate!" Such a device, he assured his patron, the
> Duke of Hanover, would be the "mother of all my inventions."



> [p87] The moment he had been elevated to privy counselor of justice in the
> court of Mainz in the summer of 1670, Leibniz launched an aggressive
> campaign to thrust himself into the limelight of the panEuropean
> intellectual scene. The first phase of this campaign consisted of
> direct-mail approaches to leading figures in the republic
> ofletters. Although he occupied a political position of some note, the
> young diplomat had not yet established his reputation in the
> intellectual world; these early letters were, in essence, cold calls.



> [p94] "We must always adapt ourselves to the world," Leibniz once
> said, "for the world will not adapt itself to us." In the political
> ideal that he advocated, reason may have been the basis for empire;
> but in the real world in which he lived and acted, as Leibniz amply
> demonstrated in his practice, reason was just one more expression of
> power, and "the good" was just another name for "the useful."



> [p116] In thinking along such lines, Leibniz recognizes that he now
> faces a "hard conclusion": He must acknowledge that the sins of a
> sinner-he names Pontius Pilate-are ultimately attributable to God:
> "For it is necessary to refer everything to some reason, and we cannot
> stop until we have arrived at a first cause--or it must be admitted
> that something can exist without a reason for its existence, and this
> admission destroys the demonstration of the existence of God and of
> many philosophical theorems." There is no clearer statement of one of
> Leibniz's core commitments: the world must be reasonable, that is,
> everything must have a reason, and even God must participate in this
> chain of reasons. The principle of sufficient reason binds everything
> together in a chain of necessity; its iron grip must begin with God
> and include even all those things we call evil, too.



> But the same commitment to reason, understood in a certain way, is the
> very foundation of Spinoza's philosophy, too. The challenge of showing
> that his own conception of God does not lead direcdy to Spinozism
> would come to dominate all of Leibniz's mature philosophy. Even in his
> letter to Wedderkopf, he indicates an awareness of the danger he
> courts. In the closing paragraph he warns his friend: "But this is
> said to you; I should not like to have it get abroad. For not even the
> most accurate remarks are understood by everyone:' Many years later,
> perhaps fearing that his earlier remarks might be too well understood,
> Leibniz took the trouble to dig up the letter and scrawl in the
> margins: "I later corrected this:'



> Leibniz spent his life trying to correct the error, yet he never quite
> erased the suspicion that he was just showing the pretty side of some
> hideous ideas borrowed &om another. To be sure, it would be naive to
> imagine that Leibniz and Spinoza fell neady into putative roles as,
> respectively, the exoteric and esoteric philosophers of
> modernity. But, even in the .days of their first exchange, there was
> already at least a hint of the possibility that, far &om being pure
> contraries, Leibniz and Spinoza were tWo very different faces of the
> same philosophical coin, always looking in the opposite directions as
> they spin through the air, yet always landing in the same place.



> [p147] The 1,000 or so thalers annually that Leibniz anticipated from
> his ideal job in Paris turns out to be about half the level of income
> he ultimately achieved in Hanover after strenuous efforts to improve
> his financial condition. According to the currency exchange rates of
> the time, 2,000 thalers was equivalent to approximately 3,300 Dutch
> guilders. Spinoza, by way of contrast, was content to live on rougWy
> 300 guilders per year (in Holland, one might add, where prices were
> significandy higher than elsewhere on the continent). If we define a
> Philosopher's Unit as the amount a given philosopher feels is required
> to sustain himself in good philosophical spirits, then we may deduce:



> 1 Leibniz Unit = 11 Spinoza Units



> That is, you could feed, house, and clothe roughly eleven Spinozas
> for the price of one Leibniz.



> [p162] It also makes no sense to say that God is "good:' according to
> Spinoza. Inasmuch as everything in the world follows of necessity from
> God's eternal essence, in fact, then we must infer that all those
> things we call "evil" are in God just as much as that which we call
> "good:' But, Spinoza elaborates, there is no good or evil in any
> absolute sense. Good and evil are relative notions-relative to us and
> our particular interests and uses. Spinoza's God-or Nature, or
> Substance-may be perfect, but it isn't good.



> Spinoza's God does not intervene in the course of events-for that
> would be to countermand itself-nor does it produce miracles-for that
> would be to contradict itself. Above all, God does not judge
> individuals and send them to heaven or hell: "God gives no laws to
> mankind so as to reward them when they fulfill them and to punish them
> when they transgress them; or, to state it more clearly, God's laws
> are not of such a nature that they could be transgressed."



> All of the traditional notions of a bearded deity blowing hot and cold
> from the heavens, in Spinoza's view, are contemptible instances of the
> human fondness for anthropomorphism. Besotted with our unruly
> imaginations, we humans often attribute to God whatever is desirable
> in a man. But, "to ascribe to God those attributes which make a man
> perfect would be as wrong as to ascribe to a man the attributes that
> make perfect an elephant or an ass:' as Spinoza scoffs to
> Blijenburgh. "If a triangle could speak," he adds, "it would say that
> God is eminently triangular."



> In Spinoza's adamant rejection of the anthropomorphic conception of
> God we may glimpse a very deep link betWeen his metaphysics and his
> politics. According to the political analysis first laid out in the
> Tractatus, the orthodox idea of God is one of the mainstays of
> tyranny. The theologians, Spinoza suggests, promote the belief in a
> fearsome, judgmental, and punishing God in order to extract obeisance
> from the superstitious masses. A people living under Spinoza's God, on
> the other hand, could easily dispense with theocratic oppression. The
> most they might require is a few scientists and philosophers.



> [p179] Many commentators, beginning in the seventeenth century, have
> gone so far as to interpret Spinoza's work as the expression of a
> characteristically Jewish theological position. His monism, they say,
> may be traced to Deuteronomy ("the Lord our God is One"); and his
> seemingly mystical tendencies link him to the Kabbalah.
> If indeed it is a religion-a very problematic possibility-then



> Spinoza's philosophy is in any case one of those religions that offers
> itself only to an elect few. The philosopher's last words on the
> highway to salvation are "all things excellent are as difficult as
> they are rare:' Part of the rarity of his way, no doubt, stems &om the
> fact that it is very difficult to read tracts like his, written in the
> geometrical style and stuffed with medieval barbarisms like
> "substance" and "attributes." But there is another sense in which
> salvation is no easy task.



> Spinoza's God is a tremendous thing (actually, it is every thing), and
> it is bound to inspire awe, wonder, and perhaps for some even
> love. But it is not the kind of thing that will love you back.



> It cannot be said that God loves mankind, much less that he should
> love them because they love him, or hate them because they hate him.



> He who loves God cannot endeavor that God should love him in return.



> [p180] "Gradually it has become clear to me what every great
> philosophy is," says Nietzsche, "namely, a personal confession of its
> creator and a kind of involuntary and unperceived memoir."



> [p194] Where Spinoza says, "All things are in God and move in God,"
> Leibniz writes: "One could say: all things are one, all things are in
> God in the way that an effect is entirely contained within its cause
> and properties of a subject are in the essence of the same subject."
> Leibniz here implicidy acknowledges that his own speculations-notably,
> his repeated suggestion that the things of the world are to God what
> properties are to an essence-are elaborations of the central doctrine
> of Spinoza's philosophy.



> "An attribute is a predicate which is conceived through itself,"
> Leibniz continues in his shipboard draft. (Spinoza himself says: "Each
> attribute. . . must be conceived through itself.") "An essence is ..."
> Suddenly, the manuscript breaks off in midword, midsentence: Essenlia
> est pr...



> Something throws Leibniz off; his quill quivers; he stops to think
> about what he is doing. He retreats from philosophy to the "philosophy
> of philosophy." His next lines are perhaps the most revealing he ever
> committed to paper:



> A metaphysics should be written with accurate definitions and
> demonstrations. But nothing should be demonstrated in it apart &om
> that which does not clash too much with received opinions. For in that
> way this metaphysics can be accepted; and once it has been approved
> then, if people examine it more deeply later, they themselves will
> draw the necessary consequences. Besides this, one can, as a separate
> undertaking, show these people later the way of reasoning about these
> things. In this metaphysics, it will be useful for there to be added
> here and there the authoritative utterances of great men, who have
> reasoned in a similar way....



> [p291] Leibniz's tendency toward a Spinozism in ethics extends beyond
> his commitment to some form of determinism and penetrates into his
> very idea of self-realization, or happiness. Because it has a conatus
> of sorts, each monad wants to "become what it is," as it were; and
> anything that contributes to this project of perfecting the self
> counts as pleasure, whereas whatever detracts from it is
> pain. "Pleasure is nothing but the feeling of an increase in
> perfection," explains Leibniz. But these words could easily have been
> lifted from Spinoza's Ethics. The more "active" a monad is-which is to
> say, the more it realizes its own nature, as opposed to submitting
> passively to the domination of other monads-the happier it is. "We
> will be happier the clearer our comprehension of things and the more
> we act in accordance with our proper nature, namely, reason," Leibniz
> clarifies. "Only to the extent that our reasonings are correct are we
> free and exempt from the pas-sions which are impressed upon us by
> surrounding bodies:' It is passages like this one-which, again, could
> simply have been cribbed from the Ethics-that lead Russell to suggest
> that, in his ethical philosophy, "Leibniz no longer shows great
> originality, but tends, with slight alterations of phraseology, to
> adopt (without acknowledgment) the views of the decried Spinoza." In
> fact, Leibniz's unswerving commitment to the guidance of reason leads
> him inexorably toward the identification of freedom and happiness that
> is the defining feature of Spinoza's ethics.
