By Richard Dawkins, Oxford University Press, May 25, 2006, 978-0199291151
A book about neo-darwinism by the greatest neo-darwinist of
them all.  It gave me a much better understanding of evolution as
a general mechanism for incremental development while teaching me
the incredible significance of the law of large numbers.  I read
the book eagerly cover to cover.
