By David MacKay, UIT Cambridge Ltd, February 20, 2009, 978-0954452933

David MacKay is a physics professor at Cambridge.  He wrote this book
to help the world, and
[he is giving it away free](http://withouthotair.com).  A paper version is
available.  I created a text only Kindle version, which is "ok" to
read.  If you want a copy, you can buy it on Amazon for $.99 or email
me.

Climate change is about numbers, not adjectives.  MacKay puts numbers
behind everything: from cell phone charges to tidal energy.  I learned
more about energy production and consumption through this book than
any other source.

MacKay has great sense of humor.  He uses it to great effect, because
it lightens up all the numbers in this book.  He goes to great lenghts
to make the book readable by non-numeric people.  If you want the
calculations, you go to the back of the book, where he provides the
equations in gory detail.  I made it through most of the technical
part.

This is abrilliant example of the law of large numbers and
stellar forces. The little bit that the earth slows down causes the
oceans to move. Stop and think about that power requirement.

Lacking physics accumen has its benefits for me. When someone
doesn't publish a computable result it's probably because the results
stink. More importantly I think all energy problems distill in fiscal
values, dollars. If someone could make money off of tides (even
semi-plausibly, i.e., enough to fool investors) they would be doing it
already.


> [k1869] One way to extract tidal energy would be to build tide farms,

Accountability is not something we can make happen, but we can
calculate the cost of errors in lives, land, and money. All systems
are imperfect, which is what this book is about so I don't think you
can talk about economics only when it is convenient. What is the cost
of large windmills in terms of lives lost constructing them? People
regularly fall off of oil rigs or die of cancer due to leaks from
toxic chemicals from refineries and fossil fuel devices.

Seems like the height of the windmills affects this number. If
