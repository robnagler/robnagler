Daniel Silva has me hooked. I started pre-ordering his books. They
read like historical fiction. The main character is an assassin, which
is weird but compelling. His front is a world-class restoration
artist, where he works on the great works. This novel doesn't have him
restoring anything, but he visits museums and discusses art.

NOTE: Fun twist to include Philby's mistress.
