A pop-psych book why ideas hold up over time, and others don't.
Chip & Dan Heath are brothers and professors at Stanford and Duke,
respectively.  They have surveyed the literature, and also practiced
their ideas on their students.

No real "sticky" quotes in the book that I want to include here.  The
basic principles are: simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness,
credibility, emotions, and stories.  Probably the most sticky
principle for me is: stories.  If you tell a story, people remember
it.  If you just give them facts, they don't.  When you tell a story,
you can provide context that is emotional, and it's likely a story is
concrete.  If the story is good, it's naturally credible and probably
unexpected.  We don't like hearing the same story over again, and we
don't like being told "tall tales".

If you haven't been exposed to pop-psych, this is a pretty good book,
because it gives pointers to the literature.  It's likely that if you
are reading this, you have been exposed to pop-psych, and you have
come across this idea elsewhere, for example, Extreme Programming
uses stories as a way for customers to write simple, concrete
requirements.
