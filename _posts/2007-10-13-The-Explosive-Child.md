By Ross W. Greene, Harper Paperbacks, 9/20/2005, 978-0060779399

A very interesting book that challenges the approach that temper
tantrums are simply a child's way of getting attention.  Certain
children explode because they can't do otherwise: they are
over-stimulated, and don't know how to cope.  Ross Greene says,
"children do well if they can."  If they aren't "doing well", it's
because they can't.  Children don't want to throw tantrums any more
than adults do.  It's an extremely uncomfortable, out-of-control
feeling.

Greene's approach is to avoid meltdowns unless you really have to
(pull a child from a busy street), or you believe the situation is an
important developmental opportunity.  Otherwise, just let it go.  This
isn't "giving up authority", but rather demonstrating maturity by
wisely picking your battles.  Most meltdowns can be avoided this way
without any loss of authority.

If you have an explosive or *implosive* child in your family, this is
a must read.  You will learn coping skills, and hopefully, learn how
to model coping skills for your child.

> strengths in another, a teacher's feedback might be as follows: "I
> know you're struggling with reading-and that makes you say you're
> stupid sometimes-but I've never seen anybody who was so good at
> math. Looks to me like you're really good in math and still need some
