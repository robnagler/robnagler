By Theodor Holm Nelson, The Distributors, 1987

Nelson is an idealist libertarian.  Fed up with the so-called technoid
approach to computers, he tries to make them more pallatable to the end
user.  Hypertext is a term he coined when he started the Xanadu project.

The book provides a terse and simplistic introduction of Xanadu and
hypertext.  First he explains the world today with all of its problems and
restrictions.  He claims that hypertext will solve the information
management problem.  A chronology of Xanadu including acknowledgements of
major contributors is provided.  Some problems in the education system are
presented as a connection to the information problem.  Vannevar Bush's "As
We May Think" is included in its entirety.

The rest (and majority) of the book is devoted to Xanadu itself, including
tumblers, enfilades, versioning, links, authoring, publishing, ... Some of
the concepts are pretty detailed and others are not described due to their
proprietary nature.  The business/development plan, legal documents for
publishing, and the description of silverstands(tm)--public access
terminal repositories to the Xanadu system--are covered in detail. 

Some comments.  He is certainly visionary, but at the same time the book
appears to be written in a sort of science fiction-like fashion.  The
silverstands(tm) are a good point, but to plan how the culture will
develop around a new technology is a little too much fiction.  The system
is only in the prototype phase and many of the critical concepts (back-end
protocol, BEBE, for example) have yet to be worked out to make the system
viable for mass marketing and world-wide distribution.  By the time the
technology is mature enough--it seems to me at least--our culture will
have radically changed.  Perhaps it will first take off in Japan in which
case how will silverstands be applicable?  In my opinion, Nelson's strong
stance on these issues weakens his primary goal.  Finally, he assumes the
system software will be sold which contradicts my experience in popular
systems.  There are two types of systems that become popular: those
bundled with the hardware and those that are given away.  I think this is
the weak point in his plan.

> [p1/20] Most peopre consider schol to be a grim necessity to be

> a mapping of the world of ideas into a sequential bureaucratic
> presentional system, with generally awful results.



> [p1/22] The project has from the first been carried out in a
> conspiratorial atmosphere on the assumption that I (later we)
> understood something others did not understand, and has reached for
> ideals others were not yet ready to comprehend.  Thisa has been
> largely true, but has deprived us of the companionship and
> inspiration of outside colleagues.  On the other hand, we have been
> confronting large-scale, indeed cosmic, social and political issues
> that many computer pople want not to think of.



> [p1/26] [The design of Xanadu] seemed so simple and clear to me
> then (in 1960).  It still does.  But like many beginning computerists,
> I mistook a clear view for a short distance.



> [p1/23] Through all of it we applied a relentless pressure for
> consistency and simplicity, and the thing cooked down remarkably.  The
> amazing fact is that it has worked, that the hard technicalities could
> be pushed to fit soft ideals.  But only by intricate search.  This
> could not have been done with schedules and deadlines.  When a project

> going to take however long it takes.
