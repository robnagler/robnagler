I am a programmer.  Over the years, I've written a lot about
[Programming](/2008/01/12/Programming-is-Easy.html).  This site collects some of these works, and is the
repository for new articles.

My opinions about programming and other subjects change over time.
For example, my book
[Extreme Perl](http://www.extremeperl.org) was my early thinking on how to devolve responsibility in a team.
The methodology parts are too structured, and are not consistent with
how I evolve software now.

[Evolution](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:robnagler.com+evolution) factors big in my current thinking about software.  This
wasn't always the case.  I was a big fan of the waterfall model in the
1980s until I saw people and relationships as the core issue.
Programming-in-the-large requires a
[team of trust](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:robnagler.com+team+trust).

Code evolves by integrating
[feedback](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:robnagler.com+feedback).  The more feedback, the better.
A team of trust is fearless and can accept any feedback thrown at it.
Team members are never fearless.  Only in a team do we create a bond
of trust that enables us to overcome our particular fears in any one
instance.

[Psychology](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:robnagler.com+psychology) figures centrally in my life and work.
I strive to understand how my psyche affects my
actions and reactions.  I visit a psychologist regularly to help me
integrate the feedback the real world throws at me.  I also rely on my
incredibly supportive family, friends, and
work colleagues.

My opinions are informed mostly by my reading.  You can find many
[reviews of books I find interesting](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:robnagler.com+BookReview) on this site.  I generally add a review a month.

Work is an extremely important part of my life.  I have had rapture of
the bits since I was nine.  I am a principal in several companies all
of which are serviced through
[bivio Software, Inc.](http://www.bivio.biz), which leverages and continuously evolves
[a large open-source platform called bOP](http://www.bivio.biz/hm/download-bOP).

In 2005 I started a non-profit called
KidCommute to encourage kids to ride bikes to school, which
operates a program called
Boltage (originally Freiker).  Boltage runs a network of devices called
ZAPs (by Dero),
which report the number of kids riding and walking
at a number of schools in the US and Canada.
I believe it's important to tend the common green.

I have not authored any patents nor do I intend to.  I am proud
to say that I ran the Swiss chapter for the League for Programming
Freedom in the 1980s.  It is less that I think patents are evil,
but they are a waste of time and energy.  My business strategy is
to work in a tightly integrated team that produces a constant
stream of great innovations.

This page will evolve over time.  It'll reflect my current thinking on
a variety of subjects, and serve as
a jumping off point
of what I think is relevant.  Alternatively, you can sign
up for the RSS feed for recent updates.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your feedback.

P.S. I believe, like many things, our society has a love/hate
relationship with simplicity.  You'll probably love/hate this
site for its extreme simplicity.
