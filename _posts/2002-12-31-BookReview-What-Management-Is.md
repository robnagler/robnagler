 Excellent customer-oriented book.  [p23] One of the most powerful
insights of modern management, however, is that there is really only
one test of a job well done -- a customer who is willing to pay for
it.

 Customers don't care how much hard work or ingenuity goes into
designing a product.  Nor are they always properly impressed by
genuine breakthroughs, as every new generate of entrepreneurs is
destined to discover.
