Ilan Pappe's research is astounding.  He pulls together amazing
facts from early Israeli military archives that have only recently
been made public.  Here's an excerpt from Plan Dalet:


> [p39] These operations can be carried out in the following manner:

> them up, and by planting mines in their debris) and especially of

> search inside them. In case of resistance, the armed forces must be

> state. Plan Dalet, 10 March, 1948


 The "demographic problem" is a huge one.  How do you create a purely
Jewish state which is democratic?  It's not possible, in my opinion.
You either have to have non-democratic repressive policies against
minorites or you cannot have an ethnically pure state.

 The official history is that the Arabs attacked the weaker Jews, but
Ben-Gurion dispells that myth in his May 24, 1948 diary entry:


> [p144] We will establish a Christian state in Lebanon, the southern
> border of which will be the Litani River. We will break Transjordan,
> bomb Amman and destroy its army, and then Syria falls, and if Egypt
> will still continue to fight - we will bombard Port Said, Alexandria
> and Cairo. This will be in revenge for what they (the Egyptians, the
> Aramis and Assyrians) did to our forefathers during Biblical times.


 The other important point of the book is that the Israelis must
reconcile their past and present atrocities.  There might be a way of
paying off this debt "legally", but the guilt is will be worse, and
it's not clear that it can officialy be recognized:


> [p245] The inability of Israelis to acknowledge the trauma the
> Palestinians suffered stands out even more sharply when set against
> the way the Palestinian national narrative tells the story of the
> Nakba, a trauma they continue to live with to the present. Had their
> victimhood been the 'natural' and 'normal' outcome of a long-term and
> bloody conflict, Israel's fears of allowing the other side to 'become'
> the victim of the conflict would not have been so intense - both sides
