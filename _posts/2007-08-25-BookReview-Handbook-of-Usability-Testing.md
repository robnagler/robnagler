Jeffrey Rubin gives a "kind of" handbook.  If you have never heard
of usability testing, then this book is for you.  It walks you through
the general tests.  The problem is that it has a dearth of real world
examples.  Basically, there's only one, whereas usability testing is
extremely complex.  Usability testers may not be able to get ahold of
enough (or any) subjects.  There are other ways to test usability,
such as, capturing live usability data from deployed applications.  I
had problems with the his assumption that user interface experts were
highly-experienced generalists.  This may be the case, but you can't
assume it.  Most people are neither highly-experienced nor
generalists.
