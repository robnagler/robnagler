By Douglas R. Hofstadter, Basic Books, March 26, 2007, 978-0465030781

This is my first Douglas Hofstadter book.  I enjoyed his writing,
and I certainly learned a lot about brains and human thought
processes.  As a programmer, I think about the brain as a
computer processor.  Since I write a lot of Perl (and other dynamic
languages), I relate to the a symbolic processing system with no
separation between the code and data.  It's just one big network of
information which is sometimes data and sometimes code.

Not being a mathematician, it was interesting to read about Goedel,
Schweitzer, etc.

Hofstadter's conjecture that are brain's software is systems of loops
rings true to me.

Chapter 20 was a bit boring to me.  It is a Socratic dialogue
discussing the idea of strange loops.

> rather, "Thank God!"), not our fate.



> We mortals are condemned not to speak at that level of no information

> essences, to put our fingers on what matters, to understand phenomena
> at amazingly high levels, to survive reliably in this world, and to
> formulate literature, art, music, and science.



> [p340] What, then, is all the fuss about "free will" about? Why do so many
> people insist on the grandiose adjective, often even finding in it
> humanity's crowning glory? What does it gain us, or rather, what would
> it gain us, if the word "free" were accurate? I honestly do not

> "free".



> I am pleased to have a will, or at least I'm pleased to have one when

> by, but I don't know what it would feel like if my will were
> Jree. What on earth would that mean? That I didn't follow my will
> sometimes? Well, why would I do that? In order to frustrate myself? I
> guess that if I wanted to frustrate myself, I might make such a choice
> - but then it would be because I wanted to frustrate myself, and
> because my meta-level desire was stronger than my plain-old
> desire. Thus I might choose not to take a second helping of noodles
> even though I - or rather, part of me - would still like some, because
> there's another part of me that wants me not to gain weight, and the
> weight-watching part happens (this evening) to have more votes than
> the gluttonous part does. If it didn't, then it would lose and my
> inner glutton would win, and that would be fine - but in either case,
> my non-free will would win out and I'd follow the dominant desire in
> my brain.

> Speaking of George, the analogy to our electoral process is such a

> [p347] Looking back at this turning point in his life from the
> perspective of many decades later, Schweitzer recalls:



> This was an abhorrent proposal, but I dared not refuse out of fear
> that he would mock me. Soon we found ourselves standing near a
> leafless tree whose branches were filled with birds singing out gaily
> in the morning, without any fear of us. My companion, crouching low
> like an Indian on a hunt, placed a pebble in the leather pouch of his
> slingshot and stretched it tightly. Obeying the imperious glance he
> threw at me, I did the same, while fighting sharp pangs of conscience
> and at the same time vowing firmly to myself that I would shoot when
> he did.



> Just at that moment, church bells began to ring out, mingling with the
> song of the birds in the sunshine. These were the early bells that
> preceded the main bells by half an hour. For me, though, they were a
> voice from Heaven. I threw my slingshot down, startling the birds so
> that they flew off to a spot safe from my companion's slingshot, and I
> fled home.



> Ever since that day, whenever the bells of Holy Week ring out amidst
> the leafless trees of spring, I have remembered with deep gratitude
> how on that fateful day they rang into my heart the commandment: "Thou
> shalt not kill." From that day on, I swore that I would liberate
> myself from the fear of other people. Whenever my inner convictions
> were at stake, I gave less weight to the opinions of other people than
> I once had. And I did my best to overcome the fear of being mocked by
> my peers.



> Here we have a classic conflict between peer pressure and one's own
> inner voices, or as we usually phrase it (and as Schweitzer himself
> put it), one's conscience. In this case, fortunately, conscience was
> the clear winner. And indeed, this was a decision that lasted a
> lifetime.



> [p354] One day, as I was trying to figure out where I personally draw
> the line for applying the word "conscious" (even though of course
> there's no sharp cutoff), it occurred to me that the most crucial
> factor was whether or not the entity in question could be said to have
> some notion, perhaps only very primitive, of "friend", a friend being
> someone you care about and who cares about you. It seems clear that
> human babies acquire the rudiments of this notion pretty early on, and
> it also seems clear that some kinds of animals - mostly but not only
> mammals - have a pretty well-developed sense of the "friend" concept.



> It's clear that dogs feel that certain humans and dogs are their
> friends, and possibly also a few other animals. I won't try to
> enumerate which types of animals seem capable of acquiring the
> "friend" notion because it's blurry and because you can run down a
> mental list just as easily I can. But the more I think about this, the
> righter it feels to me. And so I find myself led to the unexpected
> conclusion that what seems to be the epitome of selfhood - a sense of
> "I" - is in reality brought into being if and only if along with that
> self there is a sense of other selves with whom one has bonds of
> affection. In short, only when generosity is born is an ego born.
