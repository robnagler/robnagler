Lisa Cron tells the story of stories. Less of a history than
[Sapiens]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-13-Sapiens %}),
but she goes into the evolution of story. She quotes
[Antonio Damasio](http://n99.us/zdy) like many other books on
our evolution do, but Wired For Story is about writing, not
history, neuroscience, or evolutionary biology.

It took me six months to read this book. I don't remember why, but
must have been reading other things. I finished in April 2013.  I
still remember many things from this book, many years later. For
example, the importance of the first sentence and what plot is.  Cron
helped me become a better writer. I try to stick to the point (plot)
when I write, but allow various themes to creep in.

Not that I claim to be a writer, but I write things down so it was
good for me to learn a bit about writing.

> [k83] Story, as it turns out, was crucial to our evolution--more so than
> opposable thumbs. Opposable thumbs let us hang on; story told us what to
> hang on to.

> [k103] For a story to captivate a reader, it must continually meet his or
> her hardwired expectations. This is no doubt what prompted Jorge Luis
> Borges to note, "Art is fire plus algebra." Let me explain.

> [k129] After all, a good story doesn't _feel_ like an illusion. What it
> feels like is life.

> [k274] As readers we eagerly probe each piece of information for
> significance, constantly wondering, "What is this meant to tell me?" It's
> said people can go forty days without food, three days without water, and
> about thirty-five seconds without finding meaning in something--truth is,
> thirty-five seconds is an eternity compared to the warp speed with which
> our subconscious brain rips through data. It's a biological imperative:
> we are always on the hunt for meaning--not in the metaphysical "What is
> the true nature of reality?" sense but in the far more primal, very
> specific sense of: _Joe left without his usual morning coffee; I wonder
> why? Betty is always on time; how come she's half an hour late? That
> annoying dog next door barks its head off every morning; why is it so
> quiet today?_

> [k281] Having our curiosity piqued is visceral. And it leads to
> something even more potent: the anticipation of knowledge we're now
> hungry for, a sensation caused by that pleasurable rush of dopamine.
> Because being curious is necessary for survival (_What's that rustling in
> the bushes?_), nature encourages it.

> [k321] Story is visceral. We climb inside the protagonist's skin and
> become sensate, feeling what he feels.

> [k336] From the first sentence, readers morph into bloodhounds,
> relentlessly trying to sniff out what is at stake here and how will it
> impact the protagonist.

> [k366] Elmore Leonard famously said that a story is real life with the
> boring parts left out. Think of the boring parts as anything that doesn't
> relate to or affect your protagonist's quest.

> [k413] HERE'S A DISCONCERTING THOUGHT: marketers, politicians, and
> televangelists know more about story than most writers. This is because,
> by definition, they start with something writers often never even think
> about--the point their story will make. Armed with that knowledge, they
> then craft a tale in which every word, every image, every nuance leads
> directly to it.

> [k507] Happily, theme actually boils down to something incredibly simple:
> * What does the story tell us about what it means to be human?
> * What does it say about how humans react to circumstances beyond their control?

> [k511] But the real secret to theme is that it's not general; that is,
> the theme wouldn't be "love" per se--rather, it would be a very specific
> point you're making about love. For instance, a love story can be sweet
> and lyrical, revealing that people are good eggs after all; it can be
> hard-nosed and edgy, revealing that people are intense and quirky; it can
> be cynical and manipulative, revealing that people are best avoided, if
> possible.

> [k527] Not that you're as calculating as an advertising executive or that
> your story has so literal a purpose, which is why writers often have to
> stop and think about what it is they're trying to say and what point
> their story is making. It's crucial, because the instant a reader opens
> your book, his cognitive unconscious is hunting for a way to make life a
> little easier, see things a little clearer, understand people a bit
> better. So why not take a second to ask yourself, What is it I want my
> readers to walk away thinking about? What point does my story make? How
> do I want to change the way my reader sees the world?

> [k541] Plot facilitates story by forcing the protagonist to confront and
> deal with the issue that keeps him from achieving his goal. The way the
> world treats him, and how he reacts, reveals the theme.

> [k589] If theme is one of the most powerful elements of your story, it's
> also one of the most invisible.

> [k591] It's like tone of voice, which often says more than the words
> themselves. In fact, sometimes tone says the exact opposite of what the
> words are saying, as anyone who's ever been in a long-term relationship
> can attest.

> [k600] In other words, your theme begets the story's tone, which begets
> the mood the reader feels. Mood is what underlies the reader's sense of
> what is possible and what isn't in the world of your story, which brings
> us back to the point your story is making as reflected in its
> theme--_reflected_ being the key word. Because as crucial as theme is, it's
> never stated outright; it's always implied.

> [k607] Unchecked, theme is a bully, a know-it-all.

> [k608] What this means is that the more passionate you are about making
> your point, the more you have to trust your story to convey it. As Evelyn
> Waugh says, "All literature implies moral standards and criticisms, the
> less explicit the better."

> [k773] This means that everything in a story gets its emotional weight
> and meaning based on how it affects the protagonist.

> [k776] That's why in every scene you write, the protagonist must react in
> a way the reader can see and understand in the moment. This reaction must
> be specific, personal, and have an effect on whether the protagonist
> achieves her goal. What it can't be is dispassionate objective
> commentary.

> [k1100] Mirror neurons allow us to walk a mile in the protagonist's
> shoes, which means he has to actually be going somewhere. The good news
> is that everyone--real, fictional, or somewhere in between--has a goal.

> [k1364] Being wrong changes how we see--or don't see--the world. And
> we're wrong a lot, partly because in order to survive, we're wired to
> draw conclusions about everything we see, whether or not we have all--or
> any--of the facts; and partly because, more often than not, it's our
> cognitive unconscious that deftly constructs the implicit beliefs that
> then organize and rule our world.

> [k1508] It's what Fitzgerald meant when he so famously said, "Character
> is action"--meaning the things we do reveal who we are, especially
> because, as Gazzaniga reminds us, "Our actions tend to reflect our
> automatic intuitive thinking or beliefs."

> [k1541] What are we saying about human nature? How about: when you work
> up the courage to take a risk, good things happen, even if they're not
> quite the good things you expected.

> [k2094] We're hardwired to love problem solving; when we figure something
> out, the brain releases an intoxicating rush of neurotransmitters that
> say, "Good job!" The pleasure of story is trying to figure out what's
> really going on (which means that stories that ignore the first two facts
> tend to offer the reader no pleasure at all).

> [k2621] You might want to keep Samuel Johnson's advice to writers tucked
> in the back of your mind as you slash and burn: "Read over your
> compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage which you think is
> particularly fine, strike it out."

> [k2779] In fact, turns out it's unhealthy to keep a secret, both mentally
> and physically. According to psychologist James Pennebaker, "the act of
> not discussing or confiding the event with another may be more damaging
> than having experienced the event per se." Thus,

> [k2882] Stories are about people who are uncomfortable, and as we know,
> nothing makes us more uncomfortable than change. Or, as Thomas Carlyle
> said, "By nature man hates change; seldom will he quit his old home till
> it has actually fallen around his ears."

> [k2899] We all know what polite society looks like--no one needs to
> explain it to us; we get it. But beneath our very together, confident
> public persona, most of us are pretty much raging messes. Story tends to
> be about the raging mess inside, the one we struggle to keep under wraps
> as we valiantly try to make sense of our world. This is often the arena
> the real story unfolds in, and what causes the reader to marvel in
> relieved recognition, _Me too! I thought I was the only one!_
> And so, to both the writer _and_ the protagonist, Plutarch offers
> this sage advice: "It must needs be that those who aim at great deeds
> should also suffer greatly." Often in public. 
>
> Or, to put it a bit more
> philosophically, there's Jung: "One does not become enlightened by
> imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious."

> [k2928] Your brain doesn't like anything that appears random, and it will
> struggle mightily to impose order--whether it's actually there or not.

> [k2934] But one thing that isn't random is our passion for patterns, even
> if we do get carried away sometimes and see the face of our beloved
> etched in the clouds.

> [k2939] "The brain is a born cartographer," says neuroscientist Antonio
> Damasio.

> [k2942] Stories are about the things we need to keep an eye on. They
> often begin the moment a pattern in the protagonist's life stops
> working--which is good, because, as scholars Chip and Dan Heath note,
> "The most basic way to get someone's attention is this: Break a pattern."
> Can you see the fine print? In order to break a pattern, we need to know
> what the pattern is. And as far as the reader is concerned, everything is
> part of a pattern--and the thrill of reading is recognizing those
> patterns.

> [k3734] Hemingway concurred: "Work every day. No matter what has happened
> the day or night before, get up and bite on the nail." It's only then
> that the real story you're telling slowly emerges. Here's a secret: when
> you've tapped into what it is we're wired to respond to in a story, what
> we're hungry for from the very first sentence, it is your truth we hear.
> As neuroscientist David Eagleman says, "When you put together large
> numbers of pieces and parts, the whole can become something larger than
> the sum.... The concept of emergent properties means that something new
> can be introduced that is not inherent in any of the parts."
