> [p90] How did snake venom get its start?  Many animals bite, and any

> give bites that cause a painful reaction in some people.  There is a
> continuos, graded series from ordinay spit to deadly venom.



> [p92] No sensible designer would have conceived such a monstrosity
> if given a free hand to create a flatfish on a clean drawing board.  I
> suspect the most sensible designers would think in terms of of
> something more like a skate. But evolution never starts from a clean
> drawing board.  It has to start from what is already there.
