title: "BookNotes: No Right to Remain Silent: The Tragedy at Virginia Tech "

By Lucinda Roy, Harmony, March 31, 2009, 978-0307409638

Lucinda Roy was chair of the English dept at Virginia Tech before
Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 people before committing suicide.  Roy pulled
Cho from his creative writing class, because his writings and behavior
were frightening students.   Roy worked with Cho the 2005 Fall
semester at which time she recommended he get counseling.  Cho
clearly was mentally unstable, and Roy did more than recommend he get
counselling.  She contacted various University agencies, all which
failed to help Cho.

Yet, Roy does not have a specific agenda.  She writes with skill and
eloquence about all sides of the story: Cho, his family, the
University's administration, other teachers, herself, etc.  It's an
incredibly moving and impressive book.  Her goal is to explain and
provoke questions, and she does that extremely well.

Clearly written, deeply thoughtful, and few conclusions make this book
exceptional.

I agree with her perspective that we should write actively.  The
"I" in content is not egostistical, rather I am more accountable if I
write in the active voice.

When I panic I focus on the little things, that is, rearranging
the deck chairs on the Titanic when the boat is sinking. One of the
things we work on at bivio is replacing the word "think" with
"do". This is very difficult to accomplish in practice. We so much want
to know our answer is perfect that we think too much. In real life
answers are not perfect, because the information at hand is limited,
and our extrapolations are almost certainly wrong. Decisions are made,
especially during crises, out of fear, and usually the wrong fears.

The following is disturbing on many levels, but the non-obvious
feeling I had is about the use of "public". If the records were the
public's to disclose, no settlement would be needed. The fact is that
the administration, not the public, is the defendant. We often pretend
that administrations are the body they administer, which is just
false, and a dangerous assumption for the body being administered
(ruled) to make.

This is a new twist on those who can't do, teach. We have
tremendous disrespect for teaching, and in the US, we hate bureaucracy
even more. In CH, for example, people accept the need for teachers,
buereaucrats, stone masons, and so on. Stratification in society
occurs along different lines in CH (language, money, origin, ...).

This is unwise. We are all students. It's when we think we know
it all, and are done being "formed" that real dangerous thought
begins.

Cho did not buy weapons at a gun show. It is interesting that we
can buy guns online like Cho did and other mass killers but we cannot
buy alcohol online.

As a parent, I think it is my job to introduce kids to the world
of violence *slowly*. The problem is that it is everywhere. I don't
let my kids read the paper, because it is riddled with violent imagery
of *actual* acts in a very sterilized way. No TV plays in our house
except recently to allow a video game console without first person
shooter games. Yet even the free games with that came with the console
are cartoon violence. It may seem better for my sons to hit each other
as proxy Lego characters instead of real life but I have my
doubts. The acts of violence in video games are not painful nor are
the acts of pulling the trigger on a 9mm Glock in real life. Pain is
the body's feedback mechanism. When animals fight they both get hurt
so there is a natural slowing to the action. With violence with weapons
it removes this natural brake on the action. Modern violence needs
mental controls that children don't have.

There has always been a gap between kids and adults. Socrates
talked negatively about the youth of his day. This trivializes the
problem of inter-generational communication. I don't find talking with
my children easy, but I know I bear more than 50% of the
responsibility for miscommunications. I am the adult, and they are the
kids. I brought them into this world. It's my responsibility to make
sure they can cope in it. For some reason we assume this should be
easy, but every generation has their Jack the Rippers.  We need to
make sure they get help before they hurt anybody (physically or
psychologically).
