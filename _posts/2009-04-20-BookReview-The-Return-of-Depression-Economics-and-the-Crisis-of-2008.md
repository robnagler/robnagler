By Paul Krugman, W. W. Norton, December 1, 2008, 978-0393071016

Paul Krugman is a Nobel prize winner and generally renowned economist.
This book does an excellent job of pointing out the way the econonomy
is working today, and how it is related to various other crises.
Well-written and thoughtful.  I have various disagreements with
Krugman, and those don't diminish the book's value to lay people and
economists alike.

His openness to new ideas is refreshing. Krugman is also clear
that socialism failed for political as well as economic reasons.

I have a problem with simplistic views of full employment. People
are not interchangeable. You cannot turn a car mechanic into a web
developer overnight. As the economy of any country grows the jobs
available become more plentiful, but they are often the wrong type of
job. People do not adapt easily. It can take a decade to turn an
independent car mechanic into a web devloper. Who pays that person for
his education? How do you motivate that person to want to change? How
do you know that web developers will be needed in 10 years?

The problem I have with these comparisons is that GDP is but one
indicator of success. We can measure GDP statistically, but it does
not include cultural biases. For example, while my wife could choose
to work, she does not work right now. We felt it was important to
raise our children with at least one parent at home. Now that the kids
are grown, she is considering going back to work. That is our family's
cultural bias which happens to be the bias of many of the people who
work in my company. Even though population has grown in the US over my
lifetime, I am finding more and more people are choosing not to work
because they do not have to.  To me that is success. However as fewer
people who can work choose not to work we are reducing the need for
services for people who work (fewer people commuting means lower
vehicle usage, fewer business lunches, etc.) and therefore the economy
can shrink while at the same time this particular definition of
success increases.

In my experience there is a big difference between investors and
ForEx traders. Buffet is an investor and Soros is a trader. The reason
for a swift drop in a currency's price has nothing to do with
investors and everything to do with traders.  See my ^Objectively_Rich
for more info.

This is where Keynes's animal spirits are crucial to
accept. Buffet treats such panics as investment opportunities. This is
where the investors are separated from the traders. However, to be an
investor you have to have built up reserves for that rainy day when
investment opportunities present themselves. Unfortunately this means
you must be extremely disciplined and patient. You have to aim for 10
years out or more. You do not know what will be happening in 10 years,
but you do know some opportunity will present itself, and you will have
the capital to seize it. Note that capital does not have to mean cash
or equivalents. It might mean an organization primed for an
opportunity which it can handle.

Given the speed with the Thai crisis spread it is likely that the
problems were caused by speculation more than anything else. I don't
buy the argument that it was "other companies" at all. Just like in
the US in the current crisis, financial institutions overextended
themselves with high risk investments.

We live in an age which amplifies the herd and hence speculation
can be extremely profitable as Soros has shown.  It is not that Soros
is genius rather the particular herd psychology of his time is matched
to his psychology. Plenty of fallen stars demonstrate times change and
Soros is left standing as a survivor. Unfortunately unlike in biology
Soros is not replicating. Whatever his organization does is unique and
it has to be this way or the Soros strategy would fail due to the
nature of the closed system of markets.

What we need is verification which identifies all large capital
flows within companies. The cost of verification is tiny in comparison
to the cost of bailouts. In software we have learned that dynamic
systems need executable assertions.  The same is true for dynamic
financial systems. The larger the capital and the faster it flows, the
greater the risk.
