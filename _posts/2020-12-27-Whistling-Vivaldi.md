By Claude Steele, W. W. Norton, April 4, 2011, 0393339726

In [Winning the Race]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-08-02-Winning-The-Race %}),
African American Linguist John McWhorter stated,
"My response was to do the most concrete thing I could to
disabuse the students of any doubt that I was qualified to teach the
class--that is, to _prove_ it." That's fully conscious stereotype
threat, and Claude Steele states "Disproving a stereotype is a
Sisyphean task".

And, more importantly, most stereotype and identity threats are not
conscious. You don't even know you are trying disprove anything.
McWhorter was strong enough to face the real stereotype
threat head on. Steele shows that's not always possible. Simply asking
someone what their gender is puts them under stereo type threat and
hinders their performance unconsciously.

_Whisting Vivaldi_ is also about the story of Steele and his
colleagues developing
stereotype threat theory.
He shows that science is a team sport by listing dozens of his
collaborators, many who were his graduate students. He rarely is first
author on his papers, at least the ones cited in this book.

I am really impressed with the ideas in this book. It explains the
problem with the
[White Fragility]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-07-05-White-Fragility %})
approach (you are a
racist) in a way that makes sense and has experimental
support. White people's actions (e.g. Southwest Airlines First Class)
are caused by fear (stereotype threat) of being seen as a racist, and
not because one is an actual racist.

Steele uses Carol Dweck's Mindset principles in order to create
interventions that help people reduce stereotype threat and perform
better in school. That's the real power of this book: Steele shows us
that we can reduce stereotype threat. We just have to work at it, and,
of course, that's the hardest part.

> [k181] Staples was dealing with a phantom, a bad stereotype about his
> race that was in the air on the streets of Hyde Park--the stereotype that
> young African American males in this neighborhood are violence prone.

> [k183] When they were in situations where those stereotypes could apply
> to them, they understood that one false move could cause them to be
> reduced to that stereotype, to be seen and treated in terms of it. That's
> stereotype threat, a contingency of their identity in these situations.

> [k188] In a single stroke, he made the stereotype about violence-prone
> African American males less applicable to him personally.

> [k196] __Whistling Vivaldi__ is about the experience of living under such a
> cloud--an experience we all have--and the role such clouds play in
> shaping our lives and society.

> [k283] One of the first things one learns as a social psychologist is
> that everyone is capable of bias.

> [k290] Arising this way, several general patterns of findings have
> persistently emerged in this research. Seeing these patterns, more than

> importance of identity contingencies and identity threat in our lives.
>
> The first pattern is that despite the strong sense we have of
> ourselves as autonomous individuals, evidence consistently shows that
> contingencies tied to our social identities do make a difference in
> shaping our lives, from the way we perform in certain situations to the
> careers and friends we choose.

> [k297] The second dimension of reality, long evident in our research, is
> that identity threats--and the damage they can do to our
> functioning--play an important role in some of society's most important
> social problems.

> [k300] Third, also coming to light in this research is a general
> process--involving the allocation of mental resources and even a precise
> pattern of brain activation--by which these threats impair a broad range
> of human functioning.

> [k304] There is truly inspirational news here: evidence that often small,
> feasible things done to reduce these threats in schools and classrooms
> can dramatically reduce the racial and gender achievement gaps that so
> discouragingly characterize our society.

> [k443] This tidy, well-off college was no racial ghetto. And the factors
> that "downwardly constitute" black students there were less commonly
> understood than factors like distance from jobs or discrimination.

> [k447] The instances of possible racism that black students described
> weren't nearly as lawful and widespread as their underperformance. Nor
> did it seem to be caused simply by motivational or cultural deficits that
> black students brought with them.

> [k477] Quite the contrary. It saw itself as committed to their inclusion.
> The school was bewildered by the problems that followed that inclusion.
> But after I thought about group underperformance for a number of years,
> and talked to countless students along the way, two things occurred to
> me. First, like many institutions of higher education in the United
> States, this school had inherited a social organization from the larger
> society and from its own history that might well place black students
> under downwardly constituting pressures--powerful pressures not well
> understood within the traditional frameworks of prejudice and racism, on
> the one hand, or student deficits, on the other. Second, these downwardly
> constituting pressures might have the power to interfere directly and
> indirectly with __intellectual__ performance. That is, they might have the
> power to cause underperformance.

> [k494] Despite the image of science as a formal and prescribed affair,
> scientific inquiries have choice points, places where the investigator
> has to decide what to do next without much formal guidance. Intuition and
> best guesses come into play.

> [k638] And the results were dramatic. They gave us a clear answer. Among
> participants who were told the test did show gender differences, where
> the women could still feel the threat of stigma confirmation, women did
> worse than equally skilled men, just as in the earlier experiment. But
> among participants who were told the test __did not show__ gender
> differences, where the women were free of confirming anything about being
> a woman, __woman performed at the same high level as equally skilled men__.
> __Their underperformance was gone.__
>
> It is no exaggeration to say that these
> findings changed the course of our research lives.

> [k664] It was also unusual because it suggested this could happen without
> bad intentions, without the agency of prejudiced people, for example. Our
> test takers were alone in a room.

> [k699] With a coaching change, the Sonics changed. Now the sportswriters
> had to explain winning, not losing. Their player characterizations
> changed. They valorized the same players they had derided a month
> earlier. The players' weaknesses became their strengths.

> [k703] Explanations of underachievement by minority and women students
> are under the same constraints as explanations of the early 1978 Sonics.
> Almost invariably, they take an observer's perspective, and they are
> trying to explain poor performance, not success.

> [k729] It wasn't that these students had no deficiencies. Education is
> not equal in this society, in either access or quality.

> [k732] Still, the facts in my path consistently pointed away from these
> deficiencies as the sole cause.

> [k789] They performed at the same higher level as white test takers with

> [k882] But in school, when working on difficult material they understood

>

> performed at the same low level as the black rearguard students who

> [k898] Over the years we used several working names for this
> predicament--"stigmatization," "stigma pressure," "stigma vulnerability,"
> "stereotype vulnerability." Eventually we settled on "stereotype threat."
> This term captured the idea of a situational predicament as a contingency

> person's environment that went beyond any limitations within.

> [k914] For example, when the young talented white sprinter is deciding

> talented black sprinter is deciding to persist in.

> [k928] But beneath all of this work is a broadened conception of how our
> social identities shape who we are, what we do, and how well we do it.

> [k958] Broyard and his immediate family--his mother, father, and two
> sisters--were part of the Great Migration of blacks from the South to the
> urban North during the early and mid-twentieth century.

> [k962] During the 1920s, the peak years of the Great Migration, it is
> estimated that ten to thirty thousand blacks shed their black identities
> each year in precisely this way, passing into a sea of whiteness as they
> migrated north.

> [k974] He joined the army. It was apparently during his time there--who
> knows in reaction to what--that Broyard decided to renegotiate his racial
> identity. The particulars are murky. But when he came out of the army he
> left his wife and child for Greenwich Village in New York City.

> [k980] Broyard could have struggled against the limiting conditions of
> his life as a black man. But because he had the opportunity, and I am
> sure for a mix of other reasons, he decided not to.

> [k990] We typically think of race as rooted in essences--possibly
> biological, possibly cultural--that are intrinsic and defining.
> But Broyard's story of passing, like thousands of other stories
> of passing, frustrates this tendency. Nothing of his essence, biological
> or cultural, changed when he passed into the white world. He was the same
> person. What differed were the conditions he faced.

> [k1000] I borrowed the admittedly jargonistic term "contingencies" from
> behaviorism, the approach that dominated scientific psychology throughout
> much of the twentieth century.

> [k1004] And identity contingencies are contingencies that are special to
> you because you have a given social identity, things like the
> availability of a bank loan to Broyard only when he was white, or the
> lowered expectations for mental alertness one might experience as an
> older person, or the social avoidance a southerner might experience as
> his accent is heard at a New England cocktail party.

> [k1017] To explain the lunchroom's racial segregation, one needn't
> postulate even an iota of group prejudice on the part of any student in

> [k1119] For the most part, then, it is threat that allows a given
> identity to "invade [our] whole identity."

> [k1121] One of the most dramatic research traditions in social psychology
> is dramatic precisely because it consistently shows the opposite: that

> [k1142] They sacrificed profit for group advantage, even though the group

> [k1145] No type of person or nation of people has shown immunity to this
> "minimal group effect," as it is now called.

> [k1147] We think well of our group in order to think well of
> ourselves--even when the group is "minimal," a passing group, like being
> an underestimator of dots.

> [k1152] The experiments of Tajfel and his colleagues made several
> profound points that weren't obvious to the naked eye: that our need for
> self-regard was powerful enough to make us care about even trivial group
> identities; that we could discriminate against other people about whom we
> knew nothing except that they weren't members of a group we were part of,
> even when the group was trivial; and that all of this is true for
> virtually everyone on earth (although there is evidence that it is less
> true for people from collective societies).

> [k1186] She said she is still black in Paris, but it isn't the most
> central thing about her when she meets people. Her blackness, she said,
> especially as an educated black person, doesn't mean the same thing to
> people in Paris that it does in the United States.

> [k1189] She noted quickly that the French are no less prejudiced than
> anyone else.

> [k1192] She said that no matter how good her French gets, she will never
> be taken in as fully French.
>
> Nonetheless, she said that sometimes riding
> on the subway she finds herself, beneath her breath, thanking the French
> for letting her live in their country.

> [k1195] All identities are local, I have been arguing, rooted in local
> contingencies. When this woman went to Paris, she changed identity
> contingencies.
> And with the change, the psychological, everyday importance of
> her identities changed.

> [k1200] She had achieved there much of what Broyard had achieved by

> In passing you change your race but keep your country. In

>
> This is not to say that this African American
> in Paris had no vestiges of her African American identity.

> [k1210] Expatriation carries the risk of getting stranded in the new
> identity. Passing carries this risk too.

> [k1225] Two conclusions seemed unavoidable. First, our social identities
> are adaptations to the particular circumstances of our lives, what I am
> calling identity contingencies. If we didn't need them to help us cope
> with these circumstances, the perspectives, emotional tendencies, values,
> ambitions, and habits that make up the dispositional side of our social
> identities would just gradually leak out of our psyches and be gone. The
> second conclusion foreshadows the more pragmatic direction this book is
> taking. If you want to change the behaviors and outcomes associated with
> social identity--say, too few women in computer science--don't focus on
> changing the internal manifestations of the identity, such as values, and
> attitudes. Focus instead on changing the contingencies to which all of
> that internal stuff is an adaptation.

> [k1539] We thus had answers to both of our questions. Academic
> over-efforting among black students could be evoked in the
> laboratory--easily so. It's a real phenomenon. Second, it seems to be
> caused by the identity pressure of stereotype threat. It didn't happen
> without this threat, when the anagrams were presented as just anagrams,
> as puzzles unrelated to cognitive abilities. Black participants weren't
> just supermotivated students. When they weren't under stereotype threat,
> they didn't try any harder than anyone else. But when there was a
> stereotype to disprove, they tried twice as hard as everyone
> else--expending precisely the amount of extra effort that my father's
> classic piece of advice specifies.

> [k1549] So is this extra motivation always a problem for performance and
> achievement? Could literally millions of parents all be wrong?

> [k1550] __Ebony__ magazine has run a page every month for over fifty years
> featuring people who have broken down one racial barrier or another.

> [k1570] But the tables were turned on the easier test. __Women under
> stereotype threat did better than women under no stereotype threat and
> better than men in either group__.

> [k1582] Compared with women from the less underrepresented settings,
> women from the more underrepresented settings reported feeling
> substantially more pressure to prove themselves through work and reported
> more behaviors that reflected this pressure, like getting to work
> earlier, leaving later, and engaging in fewer activities outside of work.

> [k1598] Disproving a stereotype is a Sisyphean task; something you have
> to do over and over again as long as you are in the domain where the
> stereotype applies.

> [k1609] Under limited circumstances, the motivation to disprove
> stereotypes can have constructive effects. But at precisely the point
> where performance and ease of functioning are most important--at the
> limits of one's skills and knowledge as one tries to develop and grow at
> school and work--this form of motivation very often backfires.

> [k1760] A big implication of the Croizet team's finding is that a mind

> anything else we're doing.

> [k1772] Stereotype threat's impairment of working memory directly caused
> its impairment of math performance.

> [k1807] We know that stereotype threat has real effects on people. It
> causes a racing mind and a full complement of physiological and
> behavioral effects. We know that people aren't much aware of all this as
> it's happening, or at least they don't want to acknowledge it. We also

> These effects are important. But they have been studied
> primarily in single-episode experiments. Thus, I've gotten curious about

> experience in some area of one's life.

> [k1815] The facts suggest a worrisome answer: if people are under threats
> from stereotypes or other identity contingencies for long periods, they
> may pay a tax.

> [k1858] James first developed a scale to measure the values that make up
> John Henryism. It includes twelve statements such as "I've always felt
> that I could make of my life pretty much what I wanted to make of it" and
> "When things don't go the way I want them to, that just makes me work
> even harder."

> [k1867] James's guess was right: men who scored high in John Henryism
> generally had higher blood pressure than men lower in John Henryism, and
> this effect was stronger among poorer than among better-off men.

> [k1873] Whites who lived under these conditions and were high in John
> Henryism did not show elevated blood pressure.

> [k1876] The research in this chapter has a daunting, if perhaps obvious,
> message: caring about doing well in areas where your group is
> disadvantaged, discriminated against, and negatively stereotyped can
> extract a price, sometimes a very heavy price.
> You may have no choice but to care.

> [k2083] The findings also reveal something more general: when people are
> appraising identity threat, one cue can shape the interpretation of
> another. A policy that explicitly valued diversity led black respondents
> to overlook the low number of minorities in the company, a cue that
> otherwise bothered them considerably.

> [k2087] Herein may lie a principle of remedy: if enough cues in a setting
> can lead members of a group to feel "identity safe," it might neutralize
> the impact of other cues in the setting that could otherwise threaten
> them.

> [k2239] It means that even when black, Latino, and Native American
> students overcome other disadvantages in trying to gain parity with white
> and Asian classmates, they face the further pressure of stereotype and
> identity threats. Even privileged students from these groups have an
> extra, identity-related pressure working against their achievement.

> The

> [k2292] Two ways of giving this feedback didn't work as well with black

> [k2295] But one form of feedback did work, for both black and white
> students. I will call it the Tom Ostrom strategy. The feedback giver
> explained that he "used high standards" in evaluating the essays for
> publication in the teaching magazine. Still, he said, having read the
> student's essay, he believed the student could meet those standards.

> [k2380] Sometimes you can give people facing identity threat information

> setting. When this is possible, these intriguing experiments show, it
> improves the academic achievement of people in real colleges; it can put
> their achievement on very different trajectories.

> [k2437] Close to the beginning of the school year, they asked teachers to
> give each student in their classroom an envelope with his or her name on

> religion) and then write a brief paragraph about why these values were
> important to them--that is, to put these value statements in the form of
> a personal narrative.

> [k2445] Could the brief self-affirmation affect school performance?

> [k2479] Reducing identity threat, they suggest, simply increased black
> students' access to that instruction. If quality instruction hadn't been

> [k2504] But among students who focused on the expandability of
> intelligence, girls performed at the same level as the boys on this
> section--completely eliminating the usual sex difference on the test.

> [k2507] These studies show that affirmations, incremental mindsets, and

> [k2555] There were many difficult-to-change, background factors that
> caused me distress in my early days at Ohio State--my different racial
> and social class background, the absence of a critical mass of other

> causing my troubles. But the point here is that it might reduce the
> troubles themselves.

> [k2560] First, realizing that this threat arises from cues in a setting
> that signal possibly threatening contingencies of identity, one can try
> as best as possible to eliminate those real contingencies and the cues
> that signal them.

> [k2567] Second, the intervention studies show that, when the effort to
> change identity-relevant cues and contingencies in a setting can go no
> further, helping people understand the safety they do have in a setting
> is immensely valuable--academically valuable.

> [k2609] In these interventions, stereotyped students consistently got
> __better__ subsequent grades than nonstereotyped students with the same prior

> "overperformed."

> [k2644] If they arrive late, they hope for what they call "Southwest

> racist in interacting with the black passenger.

> [k2664] Our goal was to learn whether stereotype threat, in addition to
> its effects on performance, was also a common cause of tension between
> people from different groups in society, a tension that, presumably,
> could drive Americans apart.

> [k2695] For example, with the demise of the desegregation plan in
> Minneapolis, the average black student went to school with 33 percent
> fewer white students in 2000 than in 1986. Without desegregation plans,
> schools become as segregated as the neighborhoods that feed them. And
> those neighborhoods remain dramatically segregated, especially for
> whites.
> The 2000 census shows that the average white American lives in
> a neighborhood that is 80 percent white and 7 percent black, while the
> average black American lives in a neighborhood that is 33 percent white
> and 51 percent black.

> [k2716] As Loury puts it, "Opportunity travels along the synapses of
> these social networks" (chapter 6).

> [k2719] The sociologist Nancy DiTomaso recently expanded this line of
> investigation. For all of the jobs they ever had, she asked 246 people,
> twenty-five to fifty-five years old, in New Jersey, Ohio, and Tennessee,
> whether they'd been told about the job by someone they knew, whether
> someone "had put in a good word" for them, and whether they knew the
> person who hired them. For the average job, she found that 60 to 90
> percent of her respondents had benefited from one or another of these
> forms of "social capital," and 98 percent of her respondents had
> benefited from at least one of these advantages for at least one of their
> jobs.

> [k2732] This explains how seemingly ordinary associational preferences
> can have big effects. They influence who gets access to advantaging
> networks, and who doesn't.

> This was Glenn Loury's reasoning. It led him

> life--that is, racially organized residential patterns, schooling,
> friendship networks, and so on--may now be more important causes of
> racial inequality than direct discrimination against blacks.

> [k2865] We ran the basic procedure of the experiment again. But this
