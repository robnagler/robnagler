 This is an up to date version of the
[Art of Software Testing](/2000/12/31/BookReview-Art-of-Software-Testing.html). It is oriented towards waterfall development, but the technical
discussion of testing are very good.


> [p124] An excellent test case satisfies the following criteria:
> * It has a reasonable probability of catching an error.
> * It is not redundant.
> * It's the best of its breed.
> * It is neither too simple nor too complex.



> [p126] Here are a few recommendations for looking for equivalence
> classes:
> * Don't forget equivalence classes for invalid inputs.
> * Organize your classifications into a table or an outline.
> * Look for ranges of numbers.
> * Look for membership in a group.
> * Analyze responses to lists and menus.
> * Look for variables that must be equal.
> * Create time-determined equivalence classes.
> * Look for variable groups that must calculate to a certain value or a range.
> * Look for equivalent output events.
> * Look for equivalent operating environments.
