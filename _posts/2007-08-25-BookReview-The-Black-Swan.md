By Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Random House, April 17, 2007, 978-1400063512

Nassim Nicholas Taleb makes us face that our statistics are out of
whack with our observations.  Taleb is a "hyper-skeptic" along with
other skeptics such as Popper, Poincare, and Mandelbrot.  His thesis
is that our statistical techniques are based on induction and
therefore part of the problem.  Gaussian distributions do not exist in
our natural world.  Buffet & Gates are not an anomolies, they must be
part of the distribution.  Mandelbrot taught us about power laws, and
we ignored him except for the pretty pictures of fractals that are so
ubiquitous.

Taleb wants us to look for counterfactuals: data that disaffirms our
hypothesis.  Instead, we all look for confirmation: BMW drivers read
BMW ads.  We need to think about how we think about our data.  It's
all too easy to pat ourselves on the back when we find a correlation
after throwing out a few outliers -- that really don't matter, do
they?  Just the opposite: The outliers are Black Swans which effect
change.  Try a lot of things and keep what works is about the
outliers, not the average of all the things.  We have to expose
ourselves to as many Black Swans with possible positive outcomes, and
avoid as many Black Swans with possible negative outcomes.

> waistlines.  



> _In_Extremistan,_inequalities_are_such_that_one_single_observation_can_
> _disproportionately_impact_the_aggregate,_or_the_total._



> So while weight, height, and calorie consumption are from

> c. We behave as if the Black Swan does not exist: human nature is not

> d. What we see is not necessarily all that is there. History hides

> Christianity reversed this, thanks to the one man-one woman
