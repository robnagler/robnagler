By Francis A. Schaeffer, Crossway Books, 1988

I only read the essay "A Christian Manifesto", which was
first published 1981.

Schaeffer's call to action is a good one.  I believe it applies
equally well to non-Christians as well as Christians.  He strongly
believes in democracy.

> philosophy different from democracy. The solution is to limit somehow

> process.


 In other words, he wants a democratic state where people's
values are derived from some other source than television.  I could
not agree more.

 Judeo-Christian laws are certainly the basis for the U.S. and
western society as a whole.  It wasn't clear to me how this was
relevant to his discussion.  He assumes that the society in 1776 (or
whenever) was a good one.  This is romantic.  There were many bad
things about the government.  Women didn't have the right to vote.
This conflicts with a statement later in his book


> [p455] It is
> because there is a personal-infinite God who has made men and women
> in His own image that they have a unique dignity of life as human
> beings.




NOTE: Black people weren't considered human by all (but only by a
select few).  These were wrongs.  He even says that slavery is wrong.
Thus when he says,


>  [p431] The Founding Fathers of the United States (in
> varying degrees) understood very well the relationship between one's
> world view and government.
> [and] [p432] [where he quotes William Penn,]
> "If we are not governed by God, then we will be ruled by
> tyrants.",


NOTE: we were then ruled by tyrants as we are ruled now by
tyrants.  The only difference, to me, is that the tyrants wield
tremendous power over our daily lives.

 Unfortunately, this isn't true.  The failure of society is
occuring everywhere, even in places with a strong bond between
Judeo-Christian values.  In the U.S., people have religious liberty.
The problem Schaeffer confuses this with is that the *laws* are not
always to the Church's liking--a fundamental problem of "true"
democracy which Schaeffer seems to advocate.  Specifically, in the
good ol' days, we had a democracy of the property owners and the
elite (as we do today).  Jefferson and Washington were quite rich and
their position of power is directly related to their richness.  We
can look at Switzerland as a similar example.  The people in power
are often rich (Frau Kopf, Villiger, etc.).

 The point Schaeffer misses is that it isn't the shift away from
Judeo-Christian values, it's the shift *towards* burocratic control--
the government of men and not laws as Mr. Ball says.  In the past
few years, the U.S. society has been declining in wealth and
knowledge, but the government has become increasingly pro-Christian,
e.g. "The Just War" as Mr. Bush claimed.

 Agreed, just as
the Mitzvot (623 laws of Jews) is situational law based upon a
situation which is thousands of years old.  There is no justification
for not eating pork, not mixing milk and meat or not eating
shellfish.  Situational law has been around for a long time.  It was
just that the church used to condone it and now that we have "true"
democracy, the Church has much less say in the business of
government.  As Schaeffer says,


> [p441] Christians [must] show that Christianity is the Truth.


 this isn't the government's job.  If people don't believe in
Christ, they are perfectly correct under Schaeffer's reasoning.  I
just don't understand how he derives the concept that situational law
is bad from this same reasoning.


> [p441] That is, a small group of people decide

 This is clearly false.  Christianity no longer dominates
political thought nowadays.  The _majority_ of U.S. citizens
_favor_ abortion.  There is some disagreement as to whether it should
be publicly funded and, in fact, the funding has decreased
dramatically over the Reagan years (as it should if public opinion
changes).  In many religions, there is no right or wrong.  There is no
judge.  Buddhism is an example.  People's ethics are based upon their
own value system.  It the job of Christians to convince them
otherwise.  Schaeffer's point is totally invalid.

Schaeffer thinks there is a single Truth.  However, he argues that
majority belief is important:


> [p442] The Supreme Court abortion
> ruling invalidated abortion laws in all fifty states, even though it
> seems clear that in 1973 the majority of Americans were against
> abortion.


 Now the majority belief has swayed the other way.  By Schaeffer's
argumentation, the Supreme Court ruling is now proper.  Situational
law isn't a sometime thing.  Either he thinks it's bad and we should
be ruled by a single Truth and majority opinion is irrelevant *or* we
are ruled by situational law and the majority opinion is relevant.  In
any event, tyranny of the majority is real and dangerous.

I'm not arguing that situational law is correct, just that
Schaeffer's line of reasoning does convince me either way--even if I
were a Christian.  He mentions the "marketplace of freedom" quite
often.  This is the problem.  Hedonism and Nihilism are value systems
which exist in this marketplace.  The church can no longer force its
opinion on the people.  Christians can only set examples.  Hedonistic
examples appeal to the base instincts of man.  This is the problem.

 This is a fundamental theme to which he supplies no evidence.
The state doesn't require abortion, it allows for it.  If it were to
ban abortion, it would be favoring Christianity.  There is an overall
pattern.  The state used to support blue laws which favor
Christianity.  Moslems and Jews are ignored, because their days of
rest fall on Thursday-Friday and Friday-Saturday.  The state favors
the Christian calendar, but the buddhists are ignored.  I don't see
the general trend.  The U.S.  government, if anything, is fairer to
religious freedom than in other countries, e.g. Switzerland, because
they have eliminated blue laws, i.e. each proprietor is allowed to
decided themselves when their day of rest should be.  In Switzerland
that day is decided for you--according to the greater Truth.

 Actually, there are over 200
nations now which tells you that freedom is *increasing*.

 This is backwards reasoning.  Very few states have
ever had any kind of freedom.  This situation is changing towards
more freedom (on the whole).  So-called democracies are springing up
everywhere.  Schaeffer implies that freedom is decreasing.  I don't
understand why.

 This is still the majority, unfortunately.  Schaeffer
derides personal peace, because it means "leave me alone."  I claim
that it means, leave me alone until I can come to grips with my place
in society.  Many of the people are struggling to survive in an ever
increasingly complex world.  Only when people find a philosophy that
brings personal peace will they involve themselves in the affairs of
others.  People who are not at peace with themselves affect the lives
of others, e.g. child abuse and general violence.  I believe that
a major problem with the rapidly advancing technology is that more
people have free time.  Boredom breeds violence.  (Violence breeds
violence, but that's not relevant here.)  If Christians can show that
the Truth is the way, people will become at peace with themselves and
we will live in a happier world.  Some of the happiest people I know
are Christians.

 I think this is quite proper.  If the clergy isn't held
responsible for their actions, it isn't responsible.  In this case,
the clergy counseled a youth who later committed suicide.  The parents
were suing.  Schaeffer continually states that the govenment is not
above the law.  Well, it follows that the church isn't above the law,
either.  It may disagree with the law, but it must suffer the
consequences just like everyone else.

 Actually, God hasn't ordained democracy.  He used to ordain the
kings.  The concept of the nation-state didn't exist in the times when
the bible was written.  (Just like the concept of abortion didn't
exist.)  This is a traditional problem: Who judges the judges?
Literally, the bible states that we should always obey the state and
God is the judge, that is, civil disobedience is not written into the
bible.  Schaeffer implies that it does by saying the original
Christians were disobeying the state when they refused to revere the
state as the supreme authority.  This wasn't civil disobedience in a
state ordained by God, so the Christians felt they were right.  The
problem is, were they?  They only had their own personal God for
guidance.  This is where the system breaks down in my opinion.

 If my personal God says that I should allow the use of condoms but
someone else's personal God says I shouldn't, who decides who is
right?  In the U.S., condoms are legal; In Ireland, they are not.
Schaeffer never addresses this problem.  He gives many example, but
fails to establish a pattern.  For example,


> [p479] The ACLU is
> acting as the arm of the humanist consensus to force its view [that
> abortion is legal] on the *majority* of the Arkansas state
> officials.


 I don't approve of the careful use of state officials
here.  I would guess that the majority of the population favors that
abortion should be legal, but this irrelevant for him here where it
was relevant before.  This statement says nothing.  It is a
particular legal problem.  Many Christians believe that abortion
should be legal, but Schaeffer doesn't bring this up.  Are they not
"true" Christians?


> [p480] In the United States the materialistic, humanistic world
> view is being taught exclusively in most state schools.


 This comes under the concept of fair and equal.  You have to pick
one.  To teach Judeo-Christian creationism would require that we teach
*every* other religious viewpoint.  There just isn't enough time in
the day.  If we were to teach two (creationism and evolution), we
would exclude other religions unfairly.  Schaeffer says that Sagan's
statement was "made without any scientific proof for the statement."
If Schaeffer believes in "U.S. approved scientific proof", he must
support evolution as the only concept.  If he doesn't, then Sagan's
statement above is perfectly legitimate, i.e. people aren't required
to provide scientific proof to make sweeping generalizations.
Schaeffer states "even though these [private] schools were set up at
private cost by the parents in order to give their children an
education based on the world view of a universe created by a God who
objectively exists."  [The emphatic rhetoric "objectively exists"
doesn't work.  If God objectively existed, there wouldn't be this
discussion.  Objectively is used incorrectly here.]  So if I create a
school, it should automatically be approved by the state.  No,
Schaeffer doesn't say this, because this would be anarchy and
Schaeffer is vehemently opposed to anarchy (although he never defines
it).

 Many
other things are excluded from the U.S. education system, e.g.
anarchism, australian aborriginal culture, and so on.  The other
point is that this isn't a religious problem; it is freedom problem.
People can get religious instruction outside of the schools at a
minimal cost; they can't get instruction on anarchism or the like.

 The Christian system is closed as
well.  Second, the humanistic position is absolute.  Man is the
center.  It has a proper absolute value system which includes many of
the Ten Commandments.  Humanists believe that people should be
allowed to choose their destiny and Christians believe that their
destiny has already been chosen.

 Again, the concept of fair and equal comes into play.  If
there is one atheist in a class, it is unfair to make that student
say `one nation under God.'  It is unfair to make the student sit
there while the other students stand up and state it.  It is only
fair to have no one state it, but they are allowed to *think* it.  No
one is saying that there are no "gods," just that one god isn't
prefered over another god.

 I don't confess either.  I don't understand why it has to be
black & white.  My moral system is the final judge of my actions.  I
may be put in jail, but that doesn't mean I have confessed anything.
His statement is *closed* as he claims the humanist view is.

 Why does he contradict himself in 3 by "heaping guilt".  Either 2 is
true and they understand 3 implicitly or 3 is true and 2 is not.
Schaeffer's rules are unfair to those in totalitarian countries,
because he is setting a moral standard.  He is saying that these
people should only follow up to a point, but he fails to say what
that point is.  This naturally heaps guilt, because people can't know
what the point is.  In absence of an absolute system, they will
choose a relative system.  However, Schaeffer implies that the
absolute system exists.  This is unfair.

 Archbishop Romero of El Salvador was assassinated by the government
in 1980.  Schaeffer surely knew of this.  He was assassinated for
his actions and words.  I quote, "When I feed the poor, they call me
a saint.  When I ask why are the poor hungry, they call me a
communist."  Schaeffer's statements express angst for anarchism and
Marxism--two terms he never defines.  The danger he sees is real:
governments may be shown to be evil unto themselves.  I have real
problems with Schaeffer's position, because he doesn't justify it.  I
think the work being done by some of the clergy in Latin America is
wonderful.  I think that the U.S. government in many cases has been
evil.


> [p488] Man is not basically good...Man is fallen."


 This is where I disagree most strongly with Christianity.

 And what are
men?  Are kings, presidents, and generals the only servants of God?
If I elect someone and they turn around and punishes me for doing what
I consider to be "good", should I re-elect them?  In a democracy
(which Schaeffer continually supports like a good American) the
people are the kings and presidents.  They *vest* the authority in
those who they elect.  If God tells the people to elect someone, God
is interfering in the free choice of man, i.e. we know this is not
so.  Therefore, Schaeffer contradicts himself by saying man as being
not basically good and government as being good (servants of God).
He never says what happens to servants who run astray.  How are they
punished?  If they are punished by God, so be it.  Then we should all
be equal under the eyes of the Lord and elected officials (even
kings) are specifically *not* God's servants.

 First,
every attempt has not failed.  Sweden is a good example.  Private
communes are extremely good examples.  The Kibbutzim in Israel.  The
farmers' co-operatives in the U.S.  Second, who are "we" in his above
statement.  Why does the Catholic Church make its clergy take a vow
of poverty?  Is this wrong in God's eyes?  Is the pope wrong for
having denounced the Gulf War while Falwell praised it?  Who is the
judge?  When the U.S. government overthrew Allende in Chile although
he was a duly elected representative of his people, were they wrong?
Allende was a Marxist, but was the U.S. government right in
supporting Pinochet who killed many, many people?  The churches
in El Salvador are for the most part strongly against the
government's actions while the U.S. government supports them.

Finally, I would like to turn to Schaeffer's difficulty with
denouncing anarchism while supporting civil disobedience.

 It's hard to argue with the

 I agree with all these
statements.  In fact, I would guess most anarchists would agree with
these statements.  It is merely a matter of "the bottom line" as he
puts it.   The anarchists in Russia under the Czar were right in
their cause.  The Czar was a nasty person, very nasty.  At the same
time, the anarchists under Stalin were also right.

 But this is true.  The church is the collaborator,
because "the Bible has commanded us to obey the state."  This is the
definition of a collaborator.  Furthermore, he states that "it is
time we consciously realize that when any office commands what is
contrary to God's Law it abrogates its authority."  Specifically, you
become an enemy of the state by definition.

 This is my most important point.  The Bible teaches us to obey
the state in no uncertain terms.  Schaeffer uses Christian history to
justify civil disobedience, but the Bible *is* the Truth.  He never
reconciles the two.  If it is an absolute system, the Bible would
state in case X you should not follow the state.  However, it doesn't
cover this case, because God has ordained the kings.  More
specifically, we read the King James version of the bible and not the
John Doe version.  If there was any room for Schaeffer's
interpretation, it would have been removed by King James.  Schaeffer
doesn't resolve this paradox, thus his claims against anarchism hold
no weight.  Anarchism *is* a viable and Christian alternative if you
take Schaeffer's view that civil disobedience is ok.
