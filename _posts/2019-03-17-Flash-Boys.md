Flash Boys is complex book about a complex subject. It's real, and
written well. Michael Lewis is no stranger to writing about complex
subjects, and I'm glad he took up this subject: the crazy business of
high frequency trading.

I learned a lot in the book. I've worked in financial modeling, and I
know people who worked in high-frequency trading. Lewis does a great
job of documenting the details, which _matter_. If nothing else, the
business is about little details that allow some people arbitrage
their inside knowledge. Can you run your own wire from NY to Chicago,
why not? An important detail.

The fact that people were crushed by rich people makes me angry,
especially people that worked hard for the rich. You probably don't
know about [Sergey Aleynikov](http://n99.us/qgt). I didn't.

Definitely a good read. It took me about two weeks in the late summer
of 2017.

> then by prop traders at the big Wall Street banks. That was the problem,
> Puz thought. From the point of view of the most sophisticated traders,
> the stock market wasn't a mechanism for channeling capital to productive
> enterprise but a puzzle to be solved. "Investing shouldn't be about

> inconsistently compiled as to be beyond analysis. Some of it came
> time-stamped to the second; some, time-stamped in tenths of microseconds.
> None of it told you to which firms or markets your order was sent. As a

> [k3595] At one point, one of the people at the table stopped the
