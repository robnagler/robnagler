 Short and hilarious book about programming.


> [p5] Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void.  Waiting
> alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion.
> It is the source of all programs.  I do not know its name, so I will
> call it the Tao of Programming.



> If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.  If the
> operating system is great, then the compiler is great.  If the
> compiler is great, then the application is great.  The user is pleased
> and there is harmony in the world.



> The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of
> morning."



> [p7] The Tao gave birth to machine language.  Machine language gave birth
> to the assembler.



> The assembler gave birth to the compiler.  Now there are ten thousand
> languages.



> Each language has its purpose, however humble.  Each language
> expresses the yin and yang of software.  Each language has its place
> within the Tao.



> But do not program in Cobol if you can avoid it.



> [p87] Thus spake the master programmer:



> "Let the programmers be many and the managers few -- then all will be
> productive."
