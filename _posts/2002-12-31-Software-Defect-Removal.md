By Robert Dunn, McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1984
 I enjoyed this book when I first read it in the 1980s.
I re-read it thinking it would be helpful for my book:
[Extreme Perl](extremeperl.org).  However, I didn't walk away with much other than this one quote:


> [p28] For defect removal, the most prominent attribute of a
> requirements specification is its testability[.]
