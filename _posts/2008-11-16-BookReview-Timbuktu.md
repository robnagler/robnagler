Paul Auster's books always fascinate me.  I don't read many
fictional books. His are a world apart.  They are short and
complex without being overly detailed, which turns me off.  He takes
interesting viewpoints: this one is a dog's eye view of the world and
his masters.  Here's but a snippet of how the Mr. Bones (aka. Sparky)
speaks with his readers:


> [k955] What he needed was to establish some general principles, firm
> rules of conduct that he could fall back on in moments of
> crisis. Based on his recent experience, it wasn't hard to come up with
> the first item on the list. No more kids.  No more people under
> sixteen, especially boy people. They lacked compassion, and once you
> stripped that quality from a two-leg's soul, he was no better than a
> mad dog.
