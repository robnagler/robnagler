title: "BookNotes: Rich Dad's Before You Quit Your Job: 10 Real-Life Lessons Every Entrepreneur Should Know About Building a Multimillion-Dollar Business"
date: 2006-12-31T12:00:00Z

By Robert T. Kiyosaki, Sharon L. Lechter, Warner Business Books, September 14, 2005, 0446696374

The 10 lessons are: A successful business is created before there
is a business [be prepared]; Learn how to turn bad luck into good luck
[learn to fail]; Know the difference between your job and your work
[a business is many jobs]; Success reveals your failures
[communications and teams]; The process is more important than the
goal [cashflow is king]; The best answers are found in your
heart...not your head [clear mission]; the scope of the mission
determines the product [solve a problem]; Design a business that can
do something that no other business can do [clear advantage]; Don't
fight for the bargain basement [choose your customers]; Know when to
quit [you gotta wanna].

Kiyosaki gives good advice.  However, it is like many books on being
an entrepreneur.  If I didn't want to be an entrepreneur, and
I read this book, it wouldn't have changed my mind.  I want to be an
entrepreneur, and Kiyosaki explains why I want to, which doesn't
really tell me anything.  The rest is standard business stuff, which
is better presented in Jim Collins' books.


> [pxxix] In my opinion the biggest difference between an entrepreneur
> and an employee is found in the differences between the desire for
> security and the desire for freedom.



> My rich dad said, "If you become a successful entrepreneur, you will
> come to know a freedom very few people will ever know. It is not
> simply a matter of having a lot of money or free time. It is the
> freedom from the fear of fear itself."



> "Freedom from the fear of fear?" I asked.



> Nodding, he continued, "When you look under the covers of the word
> security, you find fear hiding there. This is the reason most people
> say, 'Get a good education.' It's not out of the love of study or
> scholarship, it is out of fear-the fear you won't get a good job, or
> be able to earn money. Look at how a teacher motivates students in
> school-it is motivation by fear. They say, 'If you don't study you
> will fail.' So they motivate students to study by the fear of
> failing. When the student graduates and gets a job, once again the
> motivation is fear. Employers say verbally or nonverbally, 'If you
> don't do your job, you'll be fired.' The employee works harder out of
> fear, the fear of not putting food on the table, the fear of not
> having money to make the mortgage payments. The reason people crave
> security is fear. The problem with security is that it does not cure
> fear. It simply throws a blanket over the fear, but the fear is always
> there, like the boogeyman chuckling under the bed."



> [p229] Your attorney will not agree with your accountants. Assembly
> line workers will not agree with the engineers who designed the
> assembly line. Management is at war with labor. Technical people are
> fighting with creative people. Analytical people do not get along with
> people people. College-educated people feel they're smarter than
> people who did not go to college. Add to this interoffice politics, or
> worse, sexual affairs within the company, and you will never need to
> watch TV again. In most cases, a business does not need a
> competitor. A normal business has so many competitors inside the
> business it's amazing that anyone gets any work done at all." 



> [p230] "Learn to hire slow and fire fast," said rich dad. "Take the
> hiring of people very seriously and slowly. Screen them carefully. And if
> it is time to let them go, do it quickly. Too many managers allow people
> too many chances. If you can't fire them for some reason, then move them
> and isolate them. Don't let them contaminate the rest of the people in
> the business. Maybe you can help them find jobs at a company where
> they might be happier and more productive. Or just pay them to
> leave. It will be less expensive in the long run. Remember to do it
> humanely and legally. All people need to be treated with the
> appropriate dignity. Many times, when I have let people go, they
> were happy to move on. I have found that if people are acting up or
> underperforming, it is not because they are lazy; many are simply
> unhappy for a number of reasons. If you as a leader can find a way to
> make them happy, find it." 



> [p258] One of my favorite entrepreneurs is Steven Jobs, founder of
> Apple Computer and Pixar. Not only do I like his style, I love the
> culture of his business. One of the most important things an
> entrepreneur can build is a business with a strong culture. As
> stated earlier, at The Rich Dad Company we work hard to foster and
> protect a culture of learning and free expression.
