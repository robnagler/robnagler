_Thanks for the Feedback_ is an excellent book about how to receive
feedback. I was about to write "assimilate feedback", but that's a
different concept. Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen differentiate
listening to feedback from incorporating the advice of the
giver. In fact there's a whole chapter on boundaries around feedback.

The authors build on and reuse text from their book
[Difficult Conversations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-03-19-Difficult-Conversations %}).
Receiving feedback is really a special form of difficult conversation.
The same techniques apply, but you often are thrown into a feedback
session whereas you are told in their other book to prepare for
difficult conversations.

If you know how to receive feedback, especially criticism, with a
positive attitude, you can make the most of it. The concept of
"trying it on" to see what the other person means is particularly
useful, I think. However, all their techniques are solid and backed by
modern research in psychology and neuroscience.

>
> Before you tell me how to do it better, before
> you lay out your big plans for changing, fixing, and improving me, before
> you teach me how to pick myself up and dust myself off so that I can be
> shiny and successful--know this: I've heard it before.
>
> I've been graded, rated, and ranked. Coached, screened, and
> scored. I've been picked first, picked last, and not picked at
> all. And that was just kindergarten.

> [k220] _The real leverage is creating pull_.

> [k224] We like the word "pull" because it highlights a truth often
> ignored: that the key variable in your growth is not your teacher or your
> supervisor. It's _you_.

> [k228] The majority of our learning is going to have to come from folks
> like these, so if we're serious about growth and improvement, we have no
> choice but to get good at learning from just about anyone.

> [k226] The majority of our learning is going to have to come from
> folks like these, so if we're serious about growth and improvement,
> we have no choice but to get good at learning from just about
> anyone.

> [k232] Indeed, research on happiness identifies ongoing learning and
> growth as a core ingredient of satisfaction in life.
> 
> We may be wired to learn, but it turns out that learning
> _about ourselves_ is a whole different ball game.

> [k252] In addition to our desire to learn and improve, we long for
> something else that is fundamental: to be loved, accepted, and respected
> just as we are.

> [k266] Feedback-seeking behavior--as it's called in the research
> literature--has been linked to higher job satisfaction, greater
> creativity on the job, faster adaptation in a new organization or role,
> and lower turnover. And seeking out _negative_ feedback is associated with
> higher performance ratings.

> [k315] Understanding our triggers and sorting out what set them off are
> the keys to managing our reactions and engaging in feedback conversations
> with skill.

> [k320] __Truth Triggers__ are set off by the substance of the feedback
> itself--it's somehow off, unhelpful, or simply untrue. In response, we
> feel indignant, wronged, and exasperated.

> [k323] __Relationship Triggers__ are tripped by the particular person who is
> giving us this gift of feedback.

> [k328] Identity triggers are all about us. Whether the feedback is right
> or wrong, wise or witless, something about it has caused our
> identity--our sense of who we are--to come undone.

> [k353] Broadly, feedback comes in three forms: appreciation (thanks),
> coaching (here's a better way to do it), and evaluation (here's where you
> stand). Often the receiver wants or hears one kind of feedback, while the
> giver actually means another.

> [k400] The topic of "who" defeats the topic of "what" and the original
> feedback is blocked. We call this dynamic Switchtracking.

> [k544] Evaluations align expectations, clarify consequences, and inform
> decision making.

> [k574] We need evaluation to know where we stand, to set expectations, to
> feel reassured or secure. We need coaching to accelerate learning, to
> focus our time and energy where it really matters, and to keep our
> relationships healthy and functioning. And we need appreciation if all
> the sweat and tears we put into our jobs and our relationships are going
> to feel worthwhile.

> [k608] Three qualities are required for appreciation to count. First, it
> has to be specific.

> [k616] Second, appreciation has to come in a form the receiver values and
> hears clearly.

> [k621] For some, a monthly paycheck is all the "attaboy" they need. For
> others, public recognition is meaningful, whether in the form of team
> e-mail, kudos at a meeting, or organizational awards.

> [k624] Third, meaningful appreciation has to be authentic.

> [k704] Explicit disagreement is better than implicit misunderstanding.
> Explicit disagreement leads to clarity, and is the first step in each of
> you getting your differing needs met.

> [k758] Why is wrong spotting so easy? Because there's almost always
> _something_ wrong--something the feedback giver is overlooking,
> shortchanging, or misunderstanding.

> [k818] So to clarify the feedback under the label we need to "be
> specific" about two things:
>
> (1) where the feedback is coming from, and
>
> (2) where the feedback is going.

> [k886] In any given case, you might or might not choose to follow
> someone's advice. But we can test whether advice is clear by asking this:
> If you _do_ want to follow the advice, would you know how to do so?

> [k933] The feedback giver has ideas in their head and we've been talking
> about how to get those ideas from that person's head into your head.

> [k1007] One of the primary reasons we interpret data differently is that
> we have different rules in our heads about how things _should_ be. But we
> don't think of them as _our_ rules. We think of them as _the_ rules.

> [k1021] One principle for how we organize our experiences is this: We are
> (usually) the sympathetic hero of the story.

> [k1035] Difference spotting--understanding as specifically as you can
> exactly why you and they see things differently--is a crucial lens
> through which to take in feedback.

> [k1053] Your goal is to understand the feedback giver, and for them to
> understand you. If you end up thinking the feedback is helpful, then
> you'll take it. If you don't, at least you'll understand where the
> feedback comes from, what they were suggesting, and why you're rejecting
> it.

> [k1154] Giving up wrong spotting isn't easy, and you don't have to give
> it up altogether. You can still indulge in recreational wrong spotting on
> the weekends, with friends over a beer.

> [k1187] In fact, there is always a gap between the self we think we
> present and the way others see us.

> [k1225] Who can see your face? Everyone. Who can't see your face? You.

> [k1226] But our own face is a blind spot.

> [k1254] Infants sort what they hear through the superior temporal sulcus
> (STS), located just above the ear.

> [k1258] But get this: When we ourselves speak, the STS _turns off_. We
> don't hear our own voice, at least not the same way we hear everyone
> else.

> [k1265] University College London researcher Sophie Scott speculates that
> our "listening" STS brain doesn't attend to the sound of our own voice in
> part because we are so absorbed in listening to our thoughts. Our
> attention can focus on only one thing at a time, so we focus on our
> intentions--figuring out how to say what we're trying to say.

> [k1284] Surprisingly, even on e-mail, people try to read emotions and
> tone.

> [k1330] The third amplifier has already been hinted at on the Gap Map: We
> judge ourselves by our intentions (arrow 2), while others judge us by our
> impacts (arrow 4).

> [k1340] Despite my best intentions, I may have a negative impact on you;
> you feel bossed around and micromanaged
> FIXME

> [k1344] The "fix" is to separate intentions from impacts when feedback is
> discussed.

> [k1352] All of these amplifiers--our tendency to subtract certain
> emotions from our self-description, to see missteps as situational rather
> than personality-driven, and to focus on our good intentions rather than
> our impact on others--add up. And so we get statistics like this: 37
> percent of Americans report being victims of workplace bullies, but fewer
> than 1 percent report being bullies.

> [k1369] WHAT HELPS US SEE OUR BLIND SPOTS?

> [k1370] You can't see yourself more clearly just by looking harder.

> [k1376] Instead of dismissing the feedback or the person giving it to
> you, use these thoughts as a blind-spot alert.

> [k1387] Our usual response to upsetting feedback is to reach for other
> feedback that contradicts it, in order to protect ourselves.

> [k1390] Instead of whipping out contradictory feedback, take a breath and
> look for consistent feedback--consistent in two ways.

> [k1416] A supportive mirror shows us our best self, well rested and under
> flattering light. We go to a supportive mirror for reassurance.

> [k1418] An honest mirror shows us what we look like right now, when
> we're not at our best and our bedhead is bad. It's a true reflection of
> what others saw today, when we were stressed and distracted and leaking
> our frustration.

> [k1421] Consciously or unconsciously, we often ask the people closest to
> us to be supportive mirrors.

> [k1433] For many of us, watching ourselves on video or hearing ourselves
> on audio is unpleasant at best. But it can be enormously illuminating,
> enabling us to hear our own tone and see our own behavior in ways that
> are normally invisible to us.

> [k1554] But with switchtrack conversations, we don't _realize_ there are
> two separate topics, and so both get lost as we each hear the other
> person through the filter of our own topic.

> [k1586] Credibility: They Don't Know What They're Talking About

> [k1630] Don't use the relationship trigger of trust to automatically
> disqualify the feedback.

> [k1633] Relationship triggers also explain why sometimes those closest to
> us _can't_ give us feedback, no matter how well intentioned or accurate.

> [k1659] Want to fast-track your growth? Go directly to the people you
> have the hardest time with. Ask them what you're doing that's
> exacerbating the situation. They will surely tell you.

> [k1680] Autonomy is about control, and in telling us what to do or how to
> do it, givers can trip this wire in an instant.

> [k1695] It's the paradox at the heart of many feedback conversations: We
> find it hard to take feedback from someone who doesn't accept us the way
> we are now.

> [k1703] What to the giver seems like a recommendation for a small
> behavioral tweak may feel to the receiver like a rejection of Who I Am.

> [k1777] So when you receive coaching, a question to ask yourself is this:
> Is this about helping me grow and improve, or is this the giver's way of
> raising an important relationship issue that has been upsetting them?

> [k1806] Understanding her concerns will also help ease your own
> relationship triggers--this is less about accepting who you are, and more
> about her worries about who she is, and her worries for you.

> [k2253] Happiness is believed to be one of the most highly heritable
> aspects of personality. Twin studies have led to estimates that about 50
> percent of the variance among people in their average levels of happiness
> can be explained by differences in their genes rather than in their life
> experiences.

> [k2258] First, people who have higher happiness baselines are more likely
> to respond positively to positive feedback than people with lower
> self-reported well-being.

> [k2298] Researcher Richard Davidson has found that the amount of time
> that we sustain positive emotion, or need to recover from negative
> emotion, can differ by as much as 3,000 percent across individuals.

> [k2310] Researchers have termed this the "valence hypothesis," suggesting
> that people who have more activity on the right side ("cortical
> righties") tend to be more depressed and more anxious; cortical lefties
> tend to be happier.

> [k2659] You might still find the current feedback challenging or the news
> regrettable, but in your final days, you're much more likely to regret
> the time you spent fretting

> [k2661] It's been said that comedy is tragedy plus time.

> [k2664] The ability to laugh at yourself is also an indicator that you
> are ready and able to take feedback. Laughing at yourself requires you to
> loosen your grip on your identity.

> [k2674] How others see us and how we see ourselves are inevitably
> intertwined. We need others--their perspective on us--in order to see
> ourselves clearly. Their view may be only one piece of the puzzle, but
> it's an important piece.

> [k2744] Learning profitably from feedback is not only about how we
> interpret the feedback; it's also about how we hold our identity.

> [k2774] While some of us do it naturally, we can all _learn_ to hold our
> identity in ways that make us more resilient.

> [k2776] Two shifts are crucial. We need to:
>
> (1) Give up simple identity labels and cultivate complexity; and 
>
> (2) Move from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.

> [k2795] All-or-nothing identities present us with this choice: Either we
> can exaggerate the feedback, or we can deny it.

> [k2811] Here's the bottom line: As long as you tell your self-story in
> these black-and-white terms, you will find no peace. You can't choose
> between whether you're a good person or a bad person. Whichever you
> select, there is evidence for the opposite conclusion.

> [k2827] You always saw yourself as someone who would do _anything_ for
> those you love. But now you recognize it's not that simple. 
>
> With this acceptance comes sadness, but also a kind of balance.

> [k2850] It's easy to do relationship math such that we are the wronged
> party in the equation.

> [k2899] But the bottom line is this: People do get better when they apply
> themselves, and people apply themselves when they believe they can get
> better. This is true whether we are excruciatingly bad at something or
> preternaturally good.
> 
> And effort matters most with the qualities in life that matter
> most--things like intelligence, leadership, performance, confidence,
> compassion, creativity, self-awareness, and collaboration. These all grow
> with attention and improve with coaching.

> [k2906] Dweck reports that those with growth mindsets are "amazingly
> accurate" in gauging their current abilities, while people with fixed
> mindsets are "terrible" at estimating their own proficiencies.

> [k2975] We snatch defensiveness from the jaws of learning.

> [k3012] As we figure out how to hear evaluation, it's helpful to break
> evaluation itself down into three constituent parts: assessment,
> consequences, and judgment.
> 
> _Assessment_ ranks you.

> [k3015] _Consequences_ are about the real-world outcomes that result from
> the assessment: Based on the assessment, what, if anything, is going to
> happen?

> [k3018] _Judgment_ is the story givers and receivers tell about the
> assessment and its consequences.

> [k3031] After every low score you receive, after each failure and
> faltering step, give yourself a "second score" based on how you handle
> the first score.

> [k3033] Even when you get an F for the situation itself, you can still
> earn an A+ for how you deal with it.

> [k3079] In fact, being able to establish limits on the feedback you get
> is crucial to your well-being and the health of your relationships.

> [k3094] 1. I MAY NOT TAKE YOUR ADVICE

> [k3105] 2. I DON'T WANT FEEDBACK ABOUT THAT SUBJECT, NOT RIGHT NOW

> [k3111] 3. STOP, OR I WILL LEAVE THE RELATIONSHIP

> [k3128] Unhelpful feedback is useless; relentless unhelpful feedback is
> destructive.

> [k3141] People sometimes seek attention by holding the relationship
> hostage because they don't have the skills to express their feelings of
> insecurity, anxiety, or hurt in any other way. You can be compassionate
> about the giver's needs without becoming their hostage.

> [k3181] Psychologists tell us that the most addictive reward pattern is
> called "intermittent reinforcement."

> [k3377] Broadly, feedback conversations are made up of three parts:
>
> __Open:__ A critical piece, oddly often skipped when we jump right
> in without getting aligned: What is the purpose of the conversation?

> [k3380] __Body:__ A two-way exchange of information, requiring you to
> master four main skills: listening, asserting, managing the conversation
> process, and problem solving.
>
> __Close:__ Here we clarify commitments, action
> steps, benchmarks, procedural contracts, and follow-up.

> [k3425] A key factor in happy marriages, Gottman says, is a couple's
> ability to change course, to make and respond to "repair attempts" that
> break the cycle of escalation between them.

> [k3531] If understanding is purpose one, letting the giver know you
> understand (or, just as important, that you want to understand) is
> purpose two. Listening rewards the giver's effort in taking the time to
> give you feedback, and it leaves them feeling reassured that they have
> been clear.

> [k3548] If you're overwhelmed, don't try to fight through it and inquire.
> Instead, assert. Replace hot inquiry like this: "Do you actually think
> that what you're saying is consistent or fair?" with a thoughtful
> assertion like this: "What you're suggesting seems inconsistent with the
> criteria you've used for others in my position. That doesn't seem fair to
> me." You can then circle back to listening: "Are there aspects of this
> that I'm missing?"

> [k3602] Supercommunicators had an exceptional ability to observe the
> discussion, diagnose where it was going wrong, and make explicit process
> interventions to correct it.

> [k3680] To solve the real problem, you have to understand the real
> interests. And to understand the real interests, you have to dig behind
> the stated positions and identify which bucket the interests fall into.

> [k3693] Closing with commitment can be as short as a sentence: "I want to
> think about what you've said, and let's talk tomorrow."

> [k3851] But here's the challenge: In any contest between change and the
> status quo, the status quo has home field advantage.

> [k4441] Rote thank-yous lose currency fast, but an authentic "Hey,
> watching you handle that complicated task so well is making me rethink my
> approach to those problems" can mean more than any plaque or gift
> certificate.

> [k4445] The point here is not that you have to have an "appreciation
> system" in place; rather, it's about having a cultural norm of
> appreciation that encourages everyone to notice (1) the genuine and
> unique positives in the work of others, and (2) how each team member
> hears appreciation and encouragement so that it can be best expressed to
> that person as an individual.

> [k4470] Part of what defines an organizational culture are the stories
> and myths about it--the courage or genius or endurance displayed in the
> face of impossible challenges. These stories tell us what kind of place
> we work at and what is expected of us.

> [k4556] Our sensitivity to feedback can affect not only how we receive
> feedback but also how we give it. If a manager is highly sensitive to
> negative feedback, he may not be comfortable giving negative feedback to
> others; he may assume they'll have the same painful overreactions that he
> does.

> [k4569] People who worry a lot often give an abundance of feedback as a
> way to gain a sense of control over their environment. People who have
> impossibly high standards for themselves can also hold impossibly high
> standards for others, resulting in a steady stream of coaching and
> negative evaluation, and a conspicuous silence around appreciation.

> [k4573] This is why when you are a giver, asking your receiver to coach
> you as their coach is so important.
