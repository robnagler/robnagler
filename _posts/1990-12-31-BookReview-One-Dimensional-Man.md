> 
> [p1] A comfortable, smooth, reasonable, democratic unfreedom
> prevails in advanced industrial civilization, a token of technical
> progress.



> The rights and liberties which were such
> vital factors in the origins and earlier stages of industrial society
> yield to a higher stage of this society: they are loing their
> traditional rationale and content.



> To the degree to which freedom
> from want, the concrete substance of all freedom, is becoming a real
> possibility, the liberties which pertain to a state of lower
> productivity are losing their fomer content.



> [p3] By virtue of the
> way it has organized its technological base, contemporary industrial
> society tends to be totalitarian.



> Today political power asserts itself
> through its power over the machine process and over the techinical
> organization of the apparatus.  



> [p5] 'False' [needs] are those which are
> superimposed upon the individual by particular social interests in
> his represion



> The prevalence of repressive needs ... accepted in
> ignorance and defeat ... must be undone in the interest of the happy
> individual as well as all those whose misery is the price of his
> satisfaction. 



> [p9] The intellectual and emotional refusal 'to go along' appears
> neurotic and impotent.  



> [p11] The efficiency of the system blunts
> the individuals' recognition that it contains no facts which do not
> communicate the repressive power of the whole. 



> [p12] Thus emerges a
> pattern of _one-dimensional_thought_and_behavior_ in which ideas,
> aspirations, and objectives that, by their content, transcend the
> established universe of discourse and action are either repelled or
> reduced to terms of this universe. 



> [p14] 'free' are the
> institutions which operate ... in the countries of the Free World



> [p17] Validated by the accomplishments of science and technology,
> justified by its growing productivity, the status quo defies all
> transcendence.



> _Operationalism,_ in theory and practice, becomes the
> theory and practice of _containment_. 



> [p17] Technological
> rationality reveals its political character as it becomes the great
> vehicle of better domination, creating a truly totalitarian universe
> in which society and nature, mind and body are kept in a state of
> permanent mobilization for the defense of this universe.



> [p19] The society of total mobilization, which takes shape in the
> most advanced areas of industrial civilization, combines in
> preductive union the features of the Welfare State and the Warfare
> State.  



> [p21] [T]here arises a universe of administration in which
> depressions are conrolled and conflicts stabilized by the beneficial
> effects of growing productivity and threatening nuclear war.  



> [p22]
> The classical Marxian theory...: the proletariat destroys the _political_
> apparatus of capitalism but retains the _technological_ apparatus
> However, the productive apparatus embodies technological rationality
> of capitalism.  



> [p23] [T]he notion that the liberating historical
> forces deelop _within_ the established society is a cornerstone of
> Marxian theory.



> [T]his 'space within' is being barred by a society
> in which subjects as well as objects constitute instrumentalities in
> a whole that has its raison d'etre in the accomplishments of its
> overpowering productivity.



> [p24] The laboring classes...are undergoing a decisive
> transformation[:]



> (1) Mechanization is increasingly reducing the
> quantity and intensity of physical energy expended in labor. 



> [p25]
> Now the ever-more-complete mechanization of labor in advanced
> capitalism, while sustaining exploitation, modifies the attitude and
> the status of the exploited. 



> [p27] (2) The assimilating trend shows forth
> in the occupational stratification[:] the 'blue-collar' work force
> declines in relation to the 'white-collar' element 



> [p29] (3) These
> changes ... become manifest in the widely discussed 'social and
> cultural integration' of the laboring class with capitalist society.



> [p31] (4) [Enforcing] a weakening of the negative position of the
> working class: the latter no longer appears to be the living
> contradiction to established society. 



> [p33] As the productive
> establishments rely on the military for self-preservation and growth,
> so the military relies on the corporations 'not only for their
> weapons, but also for knowledge of what kind of weapons they need,
> how much they will cost, and how long it will take to get them.'



> [p36] Automation, once it became _the_ process of material
> production, would revolutionize the whole society.  



> [p37] [O]rganized
> labor rightly opposes automation without compensating employment.
> [C]ontinued arrest of automation way weaken the copetitive national
> and international position of copital, cause a long-range depression,
> and consequently reactivate the conflict of class interests. 



> [p38]
> In view of increasing ... white-collar element ... political
> radicalization would have to be accompanied by the emergence of an
> independent political consciousness and action amoung the
> white-collar groups--a rather unlikely development  To counter this,
> the political apparatus must invest more in welfare programs
> (military subsidies as well as social).   I believe that the
> dominant interests will gradually and hesitantly accept these
> requirements 



> [p39] Soviet society is at an earlier stage of industrialization.
> Its economic and its political institutions are essentially different
> (total nationalization, and dictatorship)



> The historical
> backwardness ... compels Soviet industrialization to proceed without
> planned waste and obsolescence.



> [p40] [S]ociety must first create the
> material prerequisites of freedom for all its members before it can
> be a free society.



> And, to the degree to which the slaves have been
> preconditioned to exist as slaves and be content in that role, their
> liberation necessarily appears to come from without and from above.
> Who educates the educators, and where is the proof that they are in
> possesion of 'the good?' Who says elected representatives can do the
> right thing either?  



> [p41] The second phase Control of the
> productive process by the 'immediate producers' is supposed to
> initiate the development which distiguishes the history of free men
> from the prehistory of man. 



> [p42] [T]he actual development in
> present-day communist society postpones (or is compelled to postpone,
> by the international situation) the qualititive change to the second
> phase, and the transition from capitalism to socialism appears, in
> spite of the revolution, still as quantitative change.



> [p43] The more the rulers are capable of delivering the goods of
> consumption, the more firmly will the underlying population be tied
> to the various ruling bureaucracies. 



> [p44] One can dispense with
> the notion of an innate 'power-drive' in human nature.  



> [p43]
> [d]istribution of the necessities of life regardless of work
> perfromance, reduction of working time to a minimum, universal
> all-sided education toward exchangeability of functions?  



> [p45] The
> need for the all-out utilization of technical progress ... may prove
> stronger than the resistance of the vested bureaucracies



> [p48] [T]he prospects of containment of change, offered by the
> politics of technological rationality, depend on the prospects of the
> Welfare State. 



> [p49] [T]he Welfare State is a state of unfreedom
> because its total administration is systamitc restriction of (a)
> [free time]; (b) [goods] for vital needs; (c) the intelligence
> capable ... of self-determination.



> Late industrial society causes
> a rising standard of living and good life.



> [T]he transcending
> political forces _within_ society are arrested, and qualitative
> change appears possible only as a change from _without_.



> [p50] At the most advanced stage of capitalism, [the society prior
> to a Welfare State] is a system of subdued pluralism, in which the
> competing institutions concur in solidying the power of the whole
> over the individual.  Still, for the administered individual,
> pluraistic administration is far better than total administration.



> [p51] Advanced industrial society is indeed a system of
> countrevailing powers.  But theses forces cancel each other out in a
> higher unification--in the common interest to defend and extend the
> established position, to combat the historical alternatives, to
> contain qualitative change. 



> [p51] Neither the growing productivity
> nor the high standard of living depend on the threat from without,
> but their use for the containment of social change and perpetuation
> of servitude does. 



> [p52] Democracy would appear to be the most
> efficient system of domination.  



> [p55] The fateful interdependence
> of the only two 'soveregn' social systems in the contemporary world
> is expressive of the fact that the conflict between progress and
> politics, between man and ihs masters has become total.  They both
> struggle against a form of life which would dissolve the basis for
> domination.



> [p56]  The achievements and the failures of this society invalidate
> its higher culture.



> Man today can do _more_ than the culture heros
> and half-gods; he has solved many insoluble problems.  But he has
> also betrayed the hope and destroyed the truth which were preserved in
> the sublimations of higher culture. 



> [p57] Today's novel feature is
> the flattening out of the antagonism between culture and social
> reality through the obliteration of the oppositional, alien, and
> transcendent elements in the higher culture by virtue of which it
> constituted _another_dimension_ of reality.



> This liquidation
> occurs through [the] wholesale incorporation [of 'cultural values']
> into the established order.



> [p165] [T]he inherent limit of the established science and
> scientific methhod, by virtue of which they extend, rationalize , and
> insure the prevailing *Lebenswelt* without altering its existential
> structure---that is _without_envisaging_a_qualitatively_new_mode_
> _of_'seeing'_ and qualitatively new relations between men and between
> man and nature.



> [T]he instrumentalist horizon...created a new wold
> of theoretical and practical Reason, but it has remained committed to
> a specific historical world which has its evident limits--in theory
> as well as in proctice, in its pure as well as applied methods.



> [p166] [S]cience, _by_virtue_of_its_own_method_ and concepts, has
> projected and promoted a universe in which domination of nature has
> remained linked to the domination of man--a link which tends to be
> fatal to this universe as a whole.



> [p169] The world tends become the stuff of total administration,
> which absorbs even the administrators.  The web of domination has
> become the web of Reason itself, and this society is fatally
> entangled in it.



> [p178] 'The problems are solved, not by giving new information,
> but by arranging what we have always known.'



> The self-styled
> poverty of philosophy, committed with all its concepts to the given
> state of affairs, distrusts the possibilities of a new experience.
> Subjection to the rule of the exstablished facts is total--only
> linguistic facts, to be sure , bute the society speaks in its
> language, and we are told to obey.



> [p206] The disharmony between the individual and the social needs,
> and the lack of representative institutions in which the individuals
> work for themselves and speak for themselves, lead to the reality of
> such universals as the Nation, the Party, the Constitution, the
> Corporation, the Church--a reality which is not identical with any
> particular identifiable entity (individual, group, or institution).
> Such universals express various degrees and modes of reification.
> Their independence, althought real, is a spurious one inasmuch as it
> is that of particular powers which have organized the _whole_ of
> society. 



> [p211] The protest against the vague, obscure, metaphysical
> character of such universals, the insistence of familiar concreteness
> and protective security of ocmmon and scientific sense still reveal
> somethhing of thet primordial anxiety which guided the recorded
> origins of philisophic thought in its evolution from lreligion to
> mythology, and from mythology to logic; defense and security still
> are large atimes in the intellectual as well as national budget.



> [p218] The objects of thought and perception as they appear to the
> individuals prior to all 'subjective' interpretation have in common
> certain primary qualities, pertaining to these two layers of reality:
> (1) to the physical (natural) structure of matter, and (2) to form
> which matter has acquired in the collective historical proctice that
> has made it (matter_0 into objects _for_a_subject_.  The two layers
> or aspects of objectivity (physical and historical) are interrelated
> in such a way that they cannot be insulated from each other; the
> historical aspect can never be eliminated so radically that only the
> 'absolute' physical layer remains.



> [p221] Continuity is preserved through rupture: quantitative
> development becomes qualitative change if it attains the very
> structure of an established system; the established rationality
> becomes irrational when, in the course of its _internal_ development,
> the potentialities of the system have outgrown its institutions.
> Such internal refuration pertains to the historical character of
> reality, and the same character confers upon the concepts which
> comprehend this reality their critical intent.  They recognize and
> anticipate the irrational in the established reality--they project the
> historical negation.



> [p227] Critical thought strives to define the irrational character
> of the establised rationality  (which becomes increasingly obvious)
> and to define the tendecncies which cause this rationality to
> generate its own transformation. 'Its own' because, as hitorical
> totality, it has developed forces and capabilities which themselves
> become projects beyond the established totality.



> [p233] Instead of being separated from science and scientific
> method, and left to subjective preference and irrational,
> transcendental sanction, formerly metaphysical ideas of liberation
> may becom the proper object of scienc.  But this development
> confronts science with the unpleasant task of becoming
> _political_--of recognizing scientific consciousness as political
> consciousness, and the scientifc enterprise as political enterprise.
> For the transformation of values into needs, of final causes into
> technical possibilities is a new stage in the conquest of oppressive,
> unmastered forces in society as well as in nature.



> [p237] All joy and al happiness derive from the ability to
> transcend Nature--a transcendence in which the mastery of Nature is
> itself subordinated to liberation and pacification of existence.



> [p238] Glorification of the natural is part of the ideology which
> protects an unnatural society in its struggle against liberation.
> The defamation of birth control is a striking example.



> Civilization produces the means for freeing Nature from its own brutatility,
> its
> own insufficiency, its own blindness, by virtue of the cognitive and
> transforming power of Reason.  And Reason can fulfill this function
> only as post technological rationality, in which technics is itself
> the instrumentality of pacification, organon of the 'art of life.'
> The function of Reason then converges with the function of _Art_.



> [p240] Thus, the artistic transformation violates the natural
> object, but the iolated is itself oppressive; thus the aesthetic
> transformation is liberation.



> [p240] But outside of these small, protected areas [gardens,
> parks, & reservations], it has treated Nature as it has treated
> man--as an instrument of destructive productivity.



> [p244] This sort of privacy--the sole condition that, on the basis
> of satisfied vital needs, can give meaning to freedom and
> independence of thought--has long since become the most expensive
> commodity, available only to the very rich (who don't use it).            



> [p245] The degree to which the population is allowed to break the
> peace wherever there still is peace and silence, to be ugly and to
> uglify things, to ooze familiarity, to offend against good form is
> frightening.  It is frightening becaus it expresses the lawful and
> even organized effort ot reject the Other in his own right, to
> prevent autonomy even in a small, reserve sphere of exstence.  In the
> overdeveloped countries, an even-larger part of the population
> becomes one huge captive audience--captured not by a totalitarian
> regime but by the liberties of the citizens whose media of amusement
> and elevation compel the Other to partake of their sounds, sights,
> and smells.
