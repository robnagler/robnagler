> [p21] The behavior of sage kings did not hurt the feelings of the

> The evil kings denied the truthful and declared them outlaws, so
> as the kings enjoyed themselves everything went to ruin.



> When like and dislike began to have their say, order and chaos
> went their ways.



> [p21] Culture is a means of joining people.  Feeling are inner
> connections with an impulse to act outwardly.  Obliterate feelings by
> culture, and you lose feeling.  Destroy culture by feelings, and you
> lose culture.



> When culture is orderly and feelings are communicated, this is
> the peak of human development.



> This means that it is a virtue to take an overall view.



> [p25] The world can be gained but not taken; rulership can be
> accepted but not sought.  Rely on intelligence, and people will
> contest it; rely on power, and people will fight it.



> It is not possible to render people completely ignorant, but it
> is possible to render them unable to use there intelligence against
> you.  It is not possible to render people completely powerless, but
> it is possible to render them unable to use their power against you.
> These two things are always in the long view



> [p28] If you ride on the knowledge of the multitude, it is easy
> to gain dominion; if you only use your own mind, you cannot even
> preserve yourself.



> [p28] When there is overt public acceptance of what is still only
> an idea in the mind of the leadership, it means truthfulness has hit
> its mark.



> [p29] When manners and habits are changed without any commands or
> directives being issued, that can only be by the influence of
> kindness--laws and punishments are insufficient to bring it about.



> [p29] The abilities of one man are insufficient to govern a
> single household; but follow the measures of true reason, based on
> the nature of the universe, and the whole world is equal.



> [p30] The way of the ruler is round, revolving endlessly, with a
> nurturing spiritual influence, open and selfless, harmonious, always
> in the background and never in the forefront.



> The way of the minister is square, deliberating on what is right
> and applying appropriate measures, initiating suggestions for action,
> keeping to the job with distinct clarity, thus achieving success.



> Therefore, when ruler and minister differ in their ways, there is
> order; when they make their ways identical, their is disorder.  When
> they each manage to do what is appropriate for them and handle their
> own responsibilities, then superior and subordinate have the means to
> work together.



> [p34] Useful suggestions should not be rejected just because they
> come from people in low positions, nor should useless suggestions be
> followed just because they come from people in high positions.  Right
> and wrong are not a question of social status.  Enlightened leaders
> listen to their ministers: if their plans are useful, the leaders do
> not look down on them because of rank; and if what they say is
> feasible, the leaders do not care about how they say it.



> Ignorant rulers are not like this.  As far as their familiars and
> associates are concerned, even if they are dishonest, the rulers
> cannot see it; and when it comes to strangers and people of lowly
> status, even when they are diligent and loyal, the leaders cannot
> know it.  Those who have something to say are badgered about their
> choice of words, while those who have criticisms are punished as if
> they had committed a crime.  If you want to illumine a land and
> sustain the communities this way, that is like covering your ears to
> listen to music or covering your eyes to look at a painting--even if
> you have good hearing and eyesight, you will still be far off.



> [p54] When culture has but a superficial influence, power has a
> limited effect.  When virtue is liberally applied, authority's reign
> is extensive.



> [p71] If you focus on people's shortcoming and forget about their
> strengths, then it will be hard to find worthy people in all the
> world.



> [p72] A way that can be spoken of is not an eternal way; a name
> that can be named is not a permanent name.  What can be written down
> or passon on to others is the dregs.



> [p73] For those in prison the days are long, but for those
> condemned to die the days are short.  The length of days has its own
> measure, but they seem long in one place and short in another.  So
> there is unevenness in the heart.



> [p73] Something that is kept inside and never divulged, something
> in the feelings that never sprouts--no one ever heard of this.



> [p74] Outwardly go along with the flow, while inwardly keeping
> your true nature.  Then your eyes and ears will not be dazzled, and
> your thoughts will not be confused, while the spirit within you will
> expand greatly to roam in the realm of absolute purity.



> [p75] We may see the tip of a hair while failing to hear a peal
> of thunder, or hear the melody of a song while failing to see a
> mountain.  Why?  A small fixation of attention results in a large
> measure of heedlessness.



> [p75] When people bring up your flaws, you resent them for it;
> but when a mirror reflects your ugliness, you consider it a good
> mirror.  If people can deal with others without getting the ego
> involved, they will avoid being dragged down.
