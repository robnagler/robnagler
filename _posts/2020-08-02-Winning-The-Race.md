By John McWhorter, Avery, December 29, 2005, 1592402704

John McWhorter's [critical essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/dehumanizing-condescension-white-fragility/614146/)
of the book
[White Fragility]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-07-05-White-Fragility %})
led me to this book, which was
published in 2005. He is a professor of linguistics at Columbia, and
writes very well.

McWhorter challenges all of us, but mostly Blacks, to rethink racism
as a cause for the large Black underclass in the US. His opinions are
strong, and he backs them up with many facts wrapped in eloquent
prose. There are many topics and ideas so it is a long book. He also
blasts the opinions of specific sociologists as well as the tenor of
the sociology community. He thinks they don't do science as much as
confirm their opinions.

When I read White Fragility, I walked away with the feeling that I
could make a change if I just tried harder. McWhorter tells me that no
matter how hard I try, I can't change Black's "therapeutic
alienation," which is the root cause of underperformance of
Black students, even middle-class Blacks. Frankly, while I intend to be
less racist, McWhorter makes more sense than DiAngelo.

This does not mean I should not try to help Blacks. I am helping in a
number of ways. But, I am going to be more aware that some of my
"liberal" ways have not been so helpful.

_Winning the Race_ is not a new book. It is not nearly as popular as
_White Fragility_. It doesn't give easy answers for Whites, e.g. take
a diversity seminar. It also asks Blacks to overcome in spite of
racism, which many, many Blacks have done. In this way the book is
very inspiring to me.

> [k140] In the fall of 2003, a white supervisor at the University of
> Virginia's medical center was heard to say: "I can't believe in this day
> and age that there's a sports team in our nation's capital named the
> Redskins. That is as derogatory to Indians as having a team called
> Niggers would be to blacks."

> [k148] Soon, none other than Julian Bond, history professor at the school

> Quite simply, what happened at the University of Virginia that
> fall was divorced from any conception of human reason; it did not follow
> from A to B. This administrator was showing her awareness of the
> hurtfulness of the word __nigger__, and sticking up for exactly the
> heightened sensitivity that her opponents consider an urgent missive to
> white America.

> [k165] What they want is central to what, in other guises, created the
> world of Robert Parsons. The nut of the issue is that these people want
> neither justice nor healing. What people like this are seeking is, sadly,
> not what they claim to be seeking. They seek one thing: indignation for
> its own sake.

> [k174] There are so very many books and articles exploring the damage
> that the White Man did to black Americans' self-esteem that I will assume
> that even people far to the left of me will not even begin to dispute
> this simple proposition.

> [k178] But the fact remains that there is little connection between
> today's America and their alienation. It survives on its own steam.

> [k182] Therapeutic alienation is, itself, blind to race, and it was
> hardly unknown before the late 1960s.

> [k185] Even those most sympathetic to the countercultural movement of the
> sixties know that there was a goodly amount of performance for its own
> sake involved. It's part of how human beings are.

> [k190] Back in the day, the idea that it was progressive to obsessively
> tabulate black failure and propose that the only solution was for whites
> to become blind to race was rare to unknown in leading black ideology.

> [k192] Most blacks were more interested in fighting the concrete
> barrier of legalized __discrimination__ than the abstract psychological
> happenstance of __racism__.

> [k206] So, there is nothing to deplore about "black culture" in
> itself--our issue is what happened when black America met the New Left.

> [k208] Alienation drifted from being a spur to action to being a form
> of self-medication.

> [k217] Once established among the thoughtful and influential in America
> in the sixties, therapeutic alienation began setting off chain reactions
> that made the difference between the seedy but stable black ghettos of
> 1950 (__A Raisin in the Sun__, __Lackawanna Blues__) and the hopeless deathscape
> black ghettos of 1990 (__Boyz n the Hood__, __The Corner__).

> [k223] The welfare world we now recall so easily was born only when white
> activists such as Columbia social work professors Frances Fox Piven and
> Richard Cloward devoted themselves to bringing down the American
> financial system by dragging as many people, especially poor black ones,
> onto the welfare rolls as possible.

> [k226] But in the end, all that happened was that generations of poor
> blacks idled on the dole, getting just enough money that they were doing
> better than they could in entry-level jobs.

> [k233] In poor black Chicago in the 1920s, it was considered alarming
> that just 15 percent of babies were born out of wedlock.

> [k239] Parsons had the kids with three different mothers and lived with
> none of them. One might expect that someone with four offspring would
> work nine to five (at least?), but Parsons worked only part-time.

> [k242] Upon which we cannot help but think about the view common among
> underclass black men that punching a clock is working for "chump change,"
> regularly documented even by sympathetic sociologists.

> [k245] Parsons, for instance, seems to have at least flirted with
> stealing money instead of earning it: He had been arrested twice for
> robbery (as well as two other times for arms possession and drunk
> driving).

> [k248] Family and friends mourning his death spoke of his four kids by
> three mothers and his fitful employment as casually as women in Scarsdale
> talk of where their children are going to college.

> [k252] Again, __it is impossible to condemn him__. It's all he knew.
> But all he knew only began when whites, comforting themselves by
> fighting The Man and showing that they were not racists, decided that it
> was a form of higher wisdom to teach poor black people not to work.
> "Conservative rhetoric"?

> [k258] But before the sixties, black schools often gave solid educations
> on shoestring budgets; it is tragic how almost unseemly some find it to
> bring up schools like Dunbar High in Washington, DC, where black students
> performed excellently for decades.

> [k261] Namely, a major difference between then and now is the sense among
> many black teens that doing well in school is culturally inauthentic,
> "acting white."

> [k270] All teens, riddled with the uncertainties of an awkward age,
> cultivate alienation to express identity in various ways. Being "not
> white" is a way that is available to black kids.
>
> But it is no longer a response to racism, and it comes at the
> price of scholarly failure and narrowed opportunities.

> [k283] If rap were progressive, then by definition, very few groups would
> have criminal names because crime is not very progressive.

> [k288] And then, what is "revolutionary" about how common murder is in
> the rap world, so much so that it is a news clich<FIXME e9>? Parsons's
> murderers felt no shame in killing him over what was likely a trifle.

> [k305] Specifically, I believe that we cannot understand our past without
> fully facing that alienation and disidentification can thrive
> independently of modern causes because they can serve other psychological
> purposes. There can be no useful perspective on black America's
> trajectory that neglects the impact of therapeutic alienation.
> To move forward, we must trace it, face it, and erase it. This
> book, section by section, is about how we can do all three.

> [k351] But when Mom drove me and my sister to Temple to sit in her office
> as faculty brats while she worked (such as in the summer) or to take us
> swimming at the campus pool, she would often take a longer route, through
> the tough North Philly ghetto.

> [k353] She said she wanted me to have a sense of how other black people
> lived and how lucky we were to be middle class.

> [k361] In the 1970s, drugs were not yet the basis of the economy of these
> neighborhoods or others like them across the nation. But within ten
> years, in districts like these crack addiction would become epidemic, and
> young black men would be killing one another without a thought over turf
> wars related to the drug trade.

> [k372] What struck me was that the people in this neighborhood did not
> exactly have the air about them that we associate with the downtrodden,
> with thwarted ambition.

> [k411] That none of these scholars or writers would see factory
> relocation and the middle-class exodus as the __only__ causes is beside the
> point. They are comfortable referring to just these two factors, and
> especially the factories, as a kind of shorthand.

> [k416] Today, Wilson's thesis is the explanation of the underclass to
> which the informed person is expected to subscribe. God, how I tried to.

> [k425] After all, black Americans have always known poverty,
> underemployment, injustice, and social dismissal. Yet, the North Philly
> scene I was so familiar with was not business as usual.

> [k430] If blacks during the Great Migration of the teens and twenties
> picked up stakes and moved from the South in dogged search for
> employment, then why did their children and grandchildren not just move
> when factories moved to the suburbs?

> [k487] One even gleans a sense that some of these writers have a quiet
> sense of pride in the "thug" as a healthy rebel against the racist
> Establishment, and thus want to make sure the thug has his place in the
> black history diorama as a figure with a noble and ancient lineage. This
> perspective is not limited to black writers: Massey and Denton note that
> in 1960s ghettos, if a woman got pregnant, the man usually married or at
> least lived with her; "by the late 1980s, however, this bow to
> conventional culture had been eliminated in black street culture."

> [k507] My point is that poor black life was old news by the late sixties,
> but took an especially desperate, violent, hopeless, and narcoticized
> turn after that time.

> [k510] It's an easy score to list the usual examples of self-sufficiency
> that made Bronzeville a victory in the face of naked racism and
> segregation: several newspapers including the famous __Defender__ of national
> influence; $100,000,000 in black-owned real estate by 1929 including
> several magnificent buildings; "the Finest Colored Hotel in the World,"
> the Brookmont; 192 churches by 1929 that doubled as thriving social
> agencies helping to get poor black migrants on their feet; 731
> black-owned businesses as early as 1917; the hot jazz scene and a
> crackling literary world-within-a-world; Provident Hospital; and so on.

> [k544] We believe them when they tell us about the special task force of
> white police officers assigned to Bronzeville in the fifties, "the flying
> squad" that harrassed blacks of all classes, stopping them for moving
> violations and roughing them up, almost always when they were alone so
> there would be no witnesses.

> [k552] Not even the glummest accounts of Bronzeville give any indication
> that young black men were killing one another so frequently that their
> funerals were a monthly occurrence, as is so commonly reported from black
> inner cities today.

> [k559] So we can be aware that there have always been black slums and
> also that today's black slums are very different places.

> [k745] In that light, Indianapolis contradicts the prediction. Low-level
> manufacturing jobs never deserted this city as they did Chicago,
> Philadelphia, and other better-known ones.

> [k837] Yet, despite the injustice of this discrimination, the basic fact
> was that black people took the jobs that were available, and as such,
> black Indianapolis __worked__.

> [k1065] But then the women also openly admit that the downward trajectory
> of their lives began with periods of substance abuse and sleeping around
> in the 1970s.

> [k1087] The redlining of the old days receded after the 1960s across the
> United States, and in Indianapolis, it meant that __more__ blacks moved to
> the suburbs than stayed behind in the inner city.

> [k1118] And yet he went to work even when work was not close to home.
> Sixty years later, however, his equivalent in Chicago was telling William
> Julius Wilson things like, "The bus go out there but you don't want to
> catch the bus out there, going two hours each ways. If you have to be at
> work at eight that mean you have to leave for work at six, that mean you
> have to get up at five to be at work at eight. Then when wintertime come
> you be in trouble." This man was, not surprisingly, unemployed. The
> difference between him and the 1925 commuter in Detroit was not a matter
> of where work was, since work was just as far from the man in 1925.

> [k1123] Thus, in American cities in general, tracing inner-city chaos
> and despair to people being unable to get to work is a nimble but
> hopeless argument.

> [k1130] Strip away jargon such as "residential nucleation" and
> "industrial dispersion" and we are left with an argument that poor blacks
> in Indianapolis turned their neighborhoods into war zones because factory
> jobs moved up the road a piece. This is an unrealistic, condescending,
> and disempowering proposition, and black history deserves better.

> [k1146] The pot boiled over just now because whites, contemptuous of the
> ruling class in the wake of events in Vietnam, were newly interested in
> blacks' conditions, especially given the high visibility of the March on
> Washington, the Civil Rights legal victories, and Martin Luther King's
> subsequent assassination.

> [k1167] Black Indianapolis residents who got to move to Lockefield were
> often leaving homes with out-houses and outdoor wells.

> [k1186] Under this new conception of "leadership skills," enter people
> like Mmoja Ajabu, who set up a branch of the New Black Panthers in
> Indianapolis in 1993. Ajabu hit the scene with a distinctly
> early-nineties brand of black militance, carrying on a tantrum aimed at
> enterprising inner-city Asians, of the kind that had helped spark the
> Rodney King riots the year before. He demanded that a Korean beauty
> supply store in a black neighborhood contribute $200 a month for
> neighborhood youth programs (they refused to cough up).

> [k1226] Black people more interested in teaching fellow blacks to do
> their best __despite__ racism are not "real."

> [k1232] We have a choice, then, between two factors explaining the
> descent of a previously dignified people into a violent, feckless
> underclass.
>
> A: A new culture emerged of white-hot, unfocused animus
> against mainstream culture.
>
> B: It got a little harder to get to work.
>
> A
> black history that embraces B while dismissing A as beside the point
> substitutes therapy for common sense.

> [k1249] In 1967, Mattie Coney was asserting that "the idea of expecting a
> 'great white father' to hand one something for nothing has created a
> class of irresponsible welfare slaves.
> We must get rid of the idea that all one needs is to satisfy
> one's gullet, get drunk, have children, and throw them into the community
> to let someone else take care of them."

> [k1253] In 1964, 12,171 people were on AFDC in Marion County; by 1972,
> 34,016 people were on it.

> [k1282] Crucially, none of these poverty-stricken Indiana counties was
> among the counties where welfare tripled.

> [k1280] In 1969, 10 percent or more of residents were living below the
> poverty line in thirty of ninety-two counties in Indiana, but only in a
> mere three of these thirty counties did any blacks live at all. Moreover,
> in all three of these counties blacks numbered only in the hundreds; none
> was among the counties with healthy black populations. Crucially, none of
> these poverty-stricken Indiana counties was among the counties where
> welfare tripled.

> [k1292] In 1960--when this was still a segregated and openly bigoted
> nation--__93 percent__ of black men were employed in Indianapolis.

> [k1296] The Indiana Civil Rights Act of 1963, forcing whites to hire
> blacks, was significantly strengthened in 1969--exactly the year of the
> Indiana Avenue riot--and again in 1971.

> [k1301] Welfare hardly left one floating in cash, and in fact AFDC
> payments were on the low side in Indiana--no one was exactly sitting
> pretty from welfare checks. But they kept the wolf from the door--enough
> to dissuade countless people from seeking work.

> [k1304] In 1993, welfare payments were the equivalent of $7.50 an hour
> when the typical beginning wage in an unskilled job began at $6.50.

> [k1333] We must contrast black Indianapolis 1920 with a black man who
> former mayor Stephen Goldsmith talked to who bitterly complained about
> the paucity of jobs in Indianapolis, but refused work at McDonald's
> because they didn't pay enough, and even refused a $35,000 a year job
> driving a truck because he didn't like the hours. For those tempted to

> [k1393] Today, they are our underclass. What we must fix is the cultural
> orientation by which they have been waylaid--not __racism__.

> [k1429] Michael Eric Dyson is typical of hip-hop fans in academia in his
> defense of the recordings of gangsta rappers like Tupac Shakur as a
> "critique of a society that produces the need for the thug persona."
> That is, the lyrics' celebration of acting up, and even their
> detour into reality as rappers so often fall afoul of the law, must be
> taken as a response to an America that leaves poor blacks with no choice
> but to slide into lives that are nasty, brutish, and short.

> [k1477] Anderson quotes a black minister and part-time cab driver: "There
> are jobs out there for people who want to work. It may not be just what
> they want, but there is work to be done if you want it bad enough. Honest
> and honorable work. Something has happened to our community." "A
> comfortable perspective," Anderson smirks, shaking his head at those in
> the area who "continue to believe in the infinite availability of work in
> the traditional sense."

> [k1540] A national survey by the __Atlanta Constitution__ of ten million
> mortgage applications between 1983 and 1988 showed 11 percent rejection
> rates for whites but 24 percent for blacks--with even high-income blacks
> rejected more than low-income whites in thirty-five cities.

> [k1547] However, the problem with Massey's and Denton's thesis is the
> implications they draw from it. They assert that because of these things,
> middle-class blacks who have made it out of the 'hood are hothouse cases.

> [k1554] In 1970, only 3.6 million black people lived in the suburbs, but
> by 1995, the number was 10.6 million--when the entire black population
> was 33 million.

> [k1581] Even for blacks with somewhat less money, statistics showing
> tendencies give no grounds for leaping to a conclusion that they were all
> but barred from relocating.

> [k1584] It teaches us that even blacks with the initiative to earn and
> save enough money to seek peaceful surroundings are spineless, passive
> amoebas drifting about in the current, whose only possible response to
> challenge is to move in the other direction.
>
> After all, let us recall how offended many blacks are when
> whites suppose that all blacks live in the ghetto.

> [k1606] Black Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson has concluded, "I am
> convinced by the sociological evidence, and from my own experience, that
> any Afro-American family that truly desires to live in an integrated,
> predominantly Euro-American neighborhood--which is not to say __any__
> predominantly Euro-American neighborhood--is capable of doing so."

> [k1803] But what these people are telling us, in clear language, is that
> poor black people are incapable of behaving by themselves.

> [k1865] The middle-class exodus idea has gotten around so much partly
> because it nurtures a part of the modern black American soul.

> [k1870] Thus, the gangbanger is an antihero, but the middle-class couple
> leaving the 'hood for the 'burbs in 1972 are suspicious characters.

> [k1875] That is not only unfair and unrealistic, but also unnecessary.
> The middle-class black exodus idea makes no sense and must be disincluded
> from serious addresses of what happened in the inner cities and what to
> do about it.

> [k1884] From 1949 to 1973 no fewer than 2,500 neighborhoods were
> bulldozed in almost a thousand cities. Also, provisions for blacks who
> were relocated were vastly inadequate.
> The number of units destroyed dwarfed the number of public
> housing units built: By 1967, the ratio was ten to one in Detroit, about
> seven to one in New Haven, and so on.

> [k1901] Which means that the Eastern European Jews in __Fiddler on the
> Roof__, hounded by pogroms from their shtetls and fleeing to tall, crowded
> tenements in urban American ghettos, ended up at one another's throats on
> the Lower East Side. But they did not, as I have noted already.
> If Fullilove sees a difference between the "root shock" of
> blacks in the 1950s and that of people leaving their continent and
> language forever, I would be interested to know what it was.

> [k1911] However, the guiding idea is actually that what drove poor blacks
> over the abyss was __very__ tall buildings.

> [k1934] So even Newman's thesis leaves the question as to why high-rise
> projects went so very wrong in terms of not just crime but also so much
> else __only in the late sixties__.

> [k1938] "The pot boiled over," "blacks had had enough," yes--but even in
> 1920, blacks had endured grinding racism for almost sixty years after
> Emancipation.

> [k1941] Why no revolt __then__?
>
> Oscar Newman actually addressed this, although few seem to have
> paid much heed to this part of his exposition. He notes that in 1965, the
> federal standards for admission to the buildings were relaxed, such that
> many more families on welfare could move in. This was crucial to the
> difference between Cabrini-Green 1955 and Cabrini-Green 1995.

> [k1951] They have not engaged with the actual writings of Oscar Newman,
> and thus have not had occasion to see that he addressed solely a rise in
> criminal activity, rather than a seismic shift in broader cultural norms.
> All casual references to the effects of tall buildings on poor
> blacks neglect that the crucial factor that distinguished 1960 from 1970
> was not architectural, but cultural.

> [k2014] Okay, people separated by a highway will likely have less casual
> contact with one another than they once did. But as always, blacks are
> portrayed as bizarrely lacking human resilience.

> [k2055] But if we simply leave it at that drugs "came in," it sounds as
> if we mean that drugs were somehow imposed on black communities and that
> poor blacks were inherently incapable of resisting overusing them and
> basing their lives on selling them.

> [k2061] In which case we would expect that poor black communities in the
> 1920s under Prohibition, when the sale of alcohol was illegal, would have
> devolved into the same chaos we are familiar with in today's inner
> cities. There were, after all, plenty of black bootleggers--why would
> there not be? And they made much better money than was available in
> low-level factory and service jobs.

> [k2068] This was because drugs did not become the food and money of black
> neighborhoods until the eighties.

> [k2077] And as always, we cannot begin to say that blacks in the
> seventies were in a more miserable state than their grandparents had been
> in the twenties and thirties.

> [k2086] Or to bring it back home, why wasn't half of Harlem doing heroin
> in about 1950?

> [k2088] "Because crack is so cheap," wise folk say. But is crack __that__
> cheap?

> [k2090] And meanwhile, heroin in the 1940s was also "cheap" enough that,
> for example, Claude Brown hardly depicts it as something as pricey and
> precious as gold dust.

> [k2107] Poor blacks did not, as a rule, leap at drink or drugs this way
> __in such great numbers__ in the old days. They only did so to such a ruinous
> extent after the sixties. This was because they were now living in a
> period when the levels of basic shame in doing so were lower than they
> had ever been in American history. This was sparked initially by the
> countercultural revolution among whites, when drug use went mainstream.

> [k2168] __My explicit aim is to argue that poor blacks indeed have been
> way-laid by a culture of poverty__.

> [k2180] In Wisconsin in 1991, half of the AFDC recipients had moved in
> from other states, one in five in just the past three months. What was so
> attractive about chilly Wisconsin?
>
> Answer: It happened to give higher
> welfare payments than most states. One of the black women Jason DeParle
> covers in __American Dream__ openly tells him, "We came up here because the
> aid in Chicago wasn't nowhere as much as it was up here. We were figuring
> out how we were gonna pay our bills."

> [k2291] In 1966, that was exactly what happened. The new idea was that we
> were not to teach blacks how to deal with the System, but to teach them
> to check out of it.
>
> That year, a task force report from the Advisory
> Council on Public Welfare, __Having the Power__, __We Have the Duty__, took as a
> given that poverty is permanent and that the only solution was a
> combination of redistribution of wealth and guaranteed income: "Most
> public welfare recipients...cannot realistically be expected to become
> self-sustaining."

> [k2296] In New York in 1966, the Mobilization for Youth was set up to
> encourage poor people to apply for welfare. The organization trained its
> workers to tap an applicant's "inner victim," in language that suggests a
> dim view of the applicant's mental sophistication: "In dealing with
> low-income people who rarely have the experience or the education of
> thinking in conceptual terms, in terms of where the system is at fault,
> it's the immediate thing like the Jewish landlord, the Irish cop on the
> beat, the Italian grocery-store owner, the lousy teachers, or the welfare
> investigator...if you try to tone this down at the very beginning, you're
> running the danger, through your own intellectual and professional
> goal-setting methods, of alienating yourself from the people you want to
> organize."

> [k2304] Especially effective was the National Welfare Rights Organization
> led by former chemist George Wiley and Columbia University social work
> professors Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward, guiding troops of
> activists who were mostly black women.

> [k2307] They openly encouraged as many people as possible to be given
> AFDC payments, hoping that this would bankrupt the government and force a
> complete overhaul of our distribution of income. It wasn't that they
> thought there was no work for blacks--just that it was beneath blacks'
> dignity to start at the bottom.
> Piven's and Cloward's lefty journalist ally Richard Elman was
> dismayed that blacks were expected "to go the hard route, to be...taxi
> drivers, restaurant employees...and factory hands." The National Welfare
> Rights Organization became well known for disrupting government meetings
> and held rallies in forty cities calling for people to be allowed to
> enroll in the AFDC program.

> [k2610] But since 1996, we have learned a simple lesson: When open-ended
> welfare disappears, people work.

> [k2643] But like many writers about women in Latoya's world, Newman
> leaves unmentioned a certain elephant sitting in the middle of the
> room--namely, why did Latoya have to have the kids at all?
>
> Newman
> operates according to a certain school of thought that "respects"
> Latoya's "choices" and is extremely wary of saying or writing anything
> that could even imply a question as to poor black people's "right to
> reproduce." That may preserve the sensibilities of, well, mostly
> academics and Newman herself, since poor blacks themselves are often more
> honest about situations like Latoya's.

> [k2651] But in that era, black people who made children typically lived
> together even if they were poor or at least tried to for a spell.

> [k2655] That cultural shift left Latoya unconcerned with squaring her
> reproductive "choices" with economic reality.

> [k2672] But this simply brings us to my cultural argument. It shows that
> the days had passed when community norms would have probably held her in
> line or at best seen her go the wrong way and tsk-tsked at her as a
> "loose" woman, discouraging many young women from risking such
> opprobrium.

> [k2702] Attitude, then, plays a big part here. Contrast those ex-slaves
> in Alabama to Latoya's reminiscence: "You know, when my mother told me
> (to get an education), I was like, 'Yeah, whatever'."

> [k2705] One thing clear is that Latoya's attitude to education was never
