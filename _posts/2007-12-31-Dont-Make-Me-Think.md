By Steve Krug, New Riders Press, 8/18/2005, 0321344758

Steve Krug is a web usability consultant.  The book covers
usability well.  His writing includes too many "trivia" and "joke"
footnotes for my taste, but it doesn't distract from the message: keep
it simple and test with real people.

Since it is a book about usability, I think he could have done a
better job with the medium.  It's laid out in classic designer style,
which is nice, but it tries too hard, e.g. the square brackets around
the page numbers, which are red and centered at the bottom of the
page.  The square brackets are unnecessary, chart junk -- although I
have no doubt he has read and probably admires Tufte.

Another usability issue with the book are the references.  While he
underlines and turns blue every link in the footnotes, he doesn't do
the same in the text, where it is hard to see the link.  Another issue
is that sometimes he lists a link to a specific reference simply as
www.sensible.com or www.useit.com. (Also, sensible.com doesn't
redirect to www.sensible.com, which I find odd since it's a major
usability issue on the web.)  When you get to his website, there are
no links to the references on the home page, and if you drill down to
"The book" link, you don't get a list of references there, either.
Sometimes he has a footnote, e.g. "I'll keep an updated list of
recommendations on my Web site.", without listing the website.  I
don't want to think, give me the direct URL, thanks.

This gets back to my URLby idea, which I think has merit, but no
time.  URLby is about managing book and article references

automatically with deadlink detection and short links for printing.

Krug gets it right with this quote:

 Amen.  The book is short, which I like.  It has well-illustrated
examples.  The annotated recommended reading list includes standard
fare and some books I haven't read, which I intend to read.  It even
includes sample emails from Krug to send to CEOs who want to muck with
web designs.  The problems of web design are not new.  It's just very
hard to find the time to implement all the solutions to the problems
we see in our designs.
