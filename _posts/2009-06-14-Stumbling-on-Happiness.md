By Daniel Gilbert, Vintage, March 20, 2007, 978-1400077427

Daniel Gilbert is riotously funny, and incredibly smart.  He's a
Harvard psychologist who challenges our beliefs about our emotions,
and backs it up with a gaggle of studies.  If you see stray numbers
floating throughout the snippets below, it's due to an incredible
number of end notes.

I first learned of
[Gilbert in this video](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html)filmed at the TED conference in Feb 2004.  It was so entertaining and
shocking, I had to read his book.  The book is better than the talk,
because I like books better, and because it covers way more than his
short talk could ever cover.


> [k146] PRIESTS VOW TO REMAIN CELIBATE, physicians vow to do no
> harm, and letter carriers vow to swiftly complete their appointed
> rounds despite snow, sleet, and split infinitives. 



> [k180] The greatest achievement of the human brain is its ability to
> imagine objects and episodes that do not exist in the realm of the
> real, and it is this ability that allows us to think about the
> future. As one philosopher noted, the human brain is an "anticipation
> machine," and "making future" is the most important thing it does.



> [k190] Just as an abacus can put two and two together to produce four
> without having thoughts about arithmetic, so brains can add past to
> present to make future without ever thinking about any of them. In
> fact, it doesn't even require a brain to make predictions such as
> these. With just a little bit of training, the giant sea slug known as
> Aplysia parvula can learn to predict and avoid an electric shock to
> its gill, and as anyone with a scalpel can easily demonstrate, sea
> slugs are inarguably brainless. Computers are also brainless, but they
> use precisely the same trick the sea slug does when they turn down
> your credit card because you were trying to buy dinner in Paris after
> buying lunch in Hoboken.



> [k253] Adults do much better, of course. When a thirtyish Manhattanite
> is asked where she thinks she might retire, she mentions Miami,
> Phoenix, or some other hotbed of social rest. She may love her gritty
> urban existence right now, but she can imagine that in a few decades
> she will value bingo and prompt medical attention more than art
> museums and squeegee men.



> [k304] Contrary to the conventional medical wisdom of the previous
> century, the frontal lobe did make a difference. The difference was
> that some folks seemed better off without it. But while some surgeons
> were touting the benefits of frontal lobe damage, others were noticing
> the costs. Although patients with frontal lobe damage often performed
> well on standard intelligence tests, memory tests, and the like, they
> showed severe impairments on any test--even the very simplest
> test--that involved planning.



> [k351] This frontal lobe--the last part of the human brain to evolve,
> the slowest to mature, and the first to deteriorate in old age--is a
> time machine that allows each of us to vacate the present and
> experience the future before it happens. No other animal has a frontal
> lobe quite like ours, which is why we are the only animal that thinks
> about the future as we do.



> [k358] Now, why would anyone go all the way to India and spend his
> time, money, and brain cells just to learn how not to think about the
> future? Because, as anyone who has ever tried to learn meditation
> knows, not thinking about the future is much more challenging than
> being a psychology professor.



> [k381] Forestalling pleasure is an inventive technique for getting
> double the juice from half the fruit. Indeed,



> [k444] The fact is that human beings come into the world with a
> passion for control, they go out of the world the same way, and
> research suggests that if they lose their ability to control things at
> any point between their entrance and their exit, they become unhappy,
> helpless, hopeless, and depressed. And occasionally dead.



> [k458] Apparently, gaining control can have a positive impact on one's
> health and well-being, but losing control can be worse than never
> having had any at all.



> [k516] By the time you finish these chapters, I hope you will
> understand why most of us spend so much of our lives turning rudders
> and hoisting sails, only to find that Shangri-la isn't what and where
> we thought it would be.



> [k607] Everyone who has observed human behavior for more than thirty
> continuous seconds seems to have noticed that people are strongly,
> perhaps even primarily, perhaps even single-mindedly, motivated to
> feel happy.



> [k633] As the philosopher John Stuart Mill wrote, "It is better to be
> a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates
> dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are a
> different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the
> question."



> [k640] In short, emotional happiness is fine for pigs, but it is a
> goal unworthy of creatures as sophisticated and capable as we. Now,
> let's take a moment to think about the difficult position that someone
> who holds this view is in, and let's guess how they might resolve
> it. If you considered it perfectly tragic for life to be aimed at
> nothing more substantive and significant than a feeling, and yet you
> could not help but notice that people spend their days seeking
> happiness, then what might you be tempted to conclude? Bingo!



> [k653] A few centuries later, Christian theologians added a nifty
> twist to this classical conception: Happiness was not merely the
> product of a life of virtue but the reward for a life of virtue, and
> that reward was not necessarily to be expected in this lifetime.



> [k660] By muddling causes and consequences, philosophers have been
> forced to construct tortured defenses of some truly astonishing
> claims--for example, that a Nazi war criminal who is basking on an
> Argentinean beach is not really happy, whereas the pious missionary
> who is being eaten alive by cannibals is.



> [k669] Or how about this one: "The computer obeyed all Ten
> Commandments and was happy as a clam"? Again, sorry, but no. There is
> some remote possibility that clams can be happy because there is some
> remote possibility that clams have the capacity to feel. There may be
> something it is like to be a clam, but we can be fairly certain that
> there is nothing it is like to be a computer, and hence the computer
> cannot be happy no matter how many of its neighbor's wives it failed
> to covet.



> [k867] Studies such as these demonstrate that once we have an
> experience, we cannot simply set it aside and see the world as we
> would have seen it had the experience never happened.



> [k894] Experience stretching is a bizarre phrase but not a bizarre
> idea. We often say of others who claim to be happy despite
> circumstances that we believe should preclude it that "they only think
> they're happy because they don't know what they're missing." Okay,
> sure, but that's the point. Not knowing what we're missing can mean
> that we are truly happy under circumstances that would not allow us to
> be happy once we have experienced the missing thing. It does not mean
> that those who don't know what they're missing are less happy than
> those who have it.



> [k910] But we've talked enough about me and my vacation. Let's talk
> about me and my guitar. I've played the guitar for years, and I get
> very little pleasure from executing an endless repetition of
> three-chord blues. But when I first learned to play as a teenager, I
> would sit upstairs in my bedroom happily strumming those three chords
> until my parents banged on the ceiling and invoked their rights under
> the Geneva Convention.



> [k1012] Indeed, research shows that physiological arousal can be
> interpreted in a variety of ways, and our interpretation of our
> arousal depends on what we believe caused it. It is possible to
> mistake fear for lust, apprehension for guilt, shame for anxiety.



> [k1078] This dissociation between awareness and experience can cause
> the same sort of spookiness with regard to our emotions. Some people
> seem to be keenly aware of their moods and feelings, and may even have
> a novelist's gift for describing their every shade and flavor. Others
> of us come equipped with a somewhat more basic emotional vocabulary
> that, much to the chagrin of our romantic partners, consists primarily
> of good, not so good, and I already told you.



> [k1105] But like happiness, science is one of those words that means
> too many things to too many people and is thus often at risk of
> meaning nothing at all. My father is an eminent biologist who, after
> pondering the matter for some decades, recently revealed to me that
> psychology can't really be a science because science requires the use
> of electricity. Apparently shocks to your ankles don't count. My own
> definition of science is a bit more eclectic, but one thing about
> which I, my dad, and most other scientists can agree is that if a
> thing cannot be measured, then it cannot be studied scientifically.



> [k1296] I'll tell you about the first of them. The best way to
> understand this particular shortcoming of imagination (the faculty
> that allows us to see the future) is to understand the shortcomings of
> memory (the faculty that allows us to see the past) and perception
> (the faculty that allows us to see the present). As you will learn,
> the shortcoming that causes us to misremember the past and misperceive
> the present is the very same shortcoming that causes us to misimagine
> the future.



> [k1330] This general finding--that information acquired after an event
> alters memory of the event--has been replicated so many times in so
> many different laboratory and field settings that it has left most
> scientists convinced of two things. First, the act of remembering
> involves "filling in" details that were not actually stored; and
> second, we generally cannot tell when we are doing this because
> filling in happens quickly and unconsciously.



> [k1466] Experiments such as these suggest that we do not outgrow
> realism so much as we learn to outfox it, and that even as adults our
> perceptions are characterized by an initial moment of
> realism. According to this line of reasoning, we automatically assume
> that our subjective experience of a thing is a faithful representation
> of the thing's properties. Only later--if we have the time, energy,
> and ability--do we rapidly repudiate that assumption and consider the
> possibility that the real world may not actually be as it appears to
> us.



> [k1778] Perception, imagination, and memory are remarkable abilities
> that have a good deal in common, but in at least one way, perception
> is the wisest of the triplets.



> [k1796] When we spy the future through our prospectiscopes, the
> clarity of the next hour and the fuzziness of the next year can lead
> us to make a variety of mistakes.



> [k1818] MOST REASONABLY SIZED LIBRARIES have a shelf of futurist tomes
> from the 1950s with titles such as Into the Atomic Age and The World
> of Tomorrow.



> [k1822] Flip a few more and you'll see a sketch of a modern city under
> a glass dome, complete with nuclear trains, antigravity cars, and
> well-dressed citizens gliding smoothly to work on conveyor-belted
> sidewalks. You will also notice that some things are missing. The men
> don't carry babies, the women don't carry briefcases, the children
> don't have pierced eyebrows or nipples, and the mice go squeak instead
> of click. There are no skateboarders or panhandlers, no smartphones or
> smartdrinks, no spandex, latex, Gore-Tex, Amex, FedEx, or
> Wal-Mart. What's more, all the people of African, Asian, and Hispanic
> origin seem to have missed the future entirely. Indeed, what makes
> these drawings so charming is that they are utterly, fabulously, and
> ridiculously wrong.



> [k1839] The litany of faulty forecasts, missed marks, and prophetic
> pratfalls is extensive, but let me ask you to ignore for a moment the
> sheer number of such mistakes and notice instead the similarity of
> their forms. The writer Arthur C. Clarke formulated what has come to
> be known as Clarke's first law: "When a distinguished but elderly
> scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly
> right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very
> probably wrong." In other words, when scientists make erroneous
> predictions, they almost always err by predicting that the future will
> be too much like the present.



> [k1857] The list goes on, but what's important to notice for our
> purposes is that in each of these instances, people misremember their
> own pasts by recalling that they once thought, did, and said what they
> now think, do, and say.



> [k1941] Using the visual and auditory areas to execute acts of
> imagination is a truly ingenious bit of engineering, and evolution
> deserves the Microsoft Windows Award for installing it in every one of
> us without asking permission.



> [k2030] We cannot feel good about an imaginary future when we are busy
> feeling bad about an actual present. But rather than recognizing that
> this is the inevitable result of the Reality First policy, we
> mistakenly assume that the future event is the cause of the
> unhappiness we feel when we think about it.



> [k2045] Imagination cannot easily transcend the boundaries of the
> present, and one reason for this is that it must borrow machinery that
> is owned by perception. The fact that these two processes must run on
> the same platform means that we are sometimes confused about which one
> is running.



> [k2113] Among life's cruelest truths is this one: Wonderful things are
> especially wonderful the first time they happen, but their
> wonderfulness wanes with repetition. Just compare the first and last
> time your child said "Mama" or your partner said "I love you" and
> you'll know exactly what I mean. When we have an experience--hearing a
> particular sonata, making love with a particular person, watching the
> sun set from a particular window of a particular room--on successive
> occasions, we quickly begin to adapt to it, and the experience yields
> less pleasure each time. Psychologists call this habituation,
> economists call it declining marginal utility, and the rest of us call
> it marriage.



> [k2160] Because time is so difficult to imagine, we sometimes imagine
> it as a spatial dimension.



> [k2167] We can inspect a mental image and see who is doing what and
> where, but not when they are doing it.



> [k2168] We can inspect a mental image and see who is doing what and
> where, but not when they are doing it. In general, mental images are
> atemporal.



> [k2245] Economists shake their heads at this kind of behavior and will
> correctly tell you that your bank account contains absolute dollars
> and not "percentages off." If it is worth driving across town to save
> $50, then it doesn't matter which item you're saving it on because
> when you spend these dollars on gas and groceries, the dollars won't
> know where they came from. But these economic arguments fall on deaf
> ears because human beings don't think in absolute dollars. They think
> in relative dollars, and fifty is or isn't a lot of dollars depending
> on what it is relative to (which is why people who don't worry about
> whether their mutual-fund manager is keeping 0.5 or 0.6 percent of
> their investment will nonetheless spend hours scouring the Sunday
> paper for a coupon that gives them 40 percent off a tube of
> toothpaste). Marketers, politicians, and other agents of influence
> know about our obsession with relative magnitudes and routinely turn
> it to their own advantage.



> [k2330] Comparing and Presentism Now let's step back for a moment and
> ask what all of these facts about comparison mean for our ability to
> imagine future feelings. The facts are these: (a) value is determined
> by the comparison of one thing with another; (b) there is more than
> one kind of comparison we can make in any given instance; and (c) we
> may value something more highly when we make one kind of comparison
> than when we make a different kind of comparison. These facts suggest
> that if we want to predict how something will make us feel in the
> future, we must consider the kind of comparison we will be making in
> the future and not the kind of comparison we happen to be making in
> the present.



> [k2474] For much of the last half of the twentieth century,
> experimental psychologists timed rats as they ran mazes and observed
> pigeons as they pecked keys because they believed that the best way to
> understand behavior was to map the relation between a stimulus and an
> organism's response to that stimulus. By carefully measuring what an
> organism did when it was presented with a physical stimulus, such as a
> light, a sound, or a piece of food, psychologists hoped to develop a
> science that linked observable stimuli to observable behavior without
> using vague and squishy concepts such as meaning to connect
> them. Alas, this simpleminded project was doomed from the start,
> because while rats and pigeons may respond to stimuli as they are
> presented in the world, people respond to stimuli as they are
> represented in the mind.



> [k2507] Unlike rats and pigeons, then, we respond to meanings--and
> context, frequency, and recency are three of the factors that
> determine which meaning we will infer when we encounter an ambiguous
> stimulus. But there is another factor of equal importance and greater
> interest. Like rats and pigeons, each of us has desires, wishes, and
> needs. We are not merely spectators of the world but investors in it,
> and we often prefer that an ambiguous stimulus mean one thing rather
> than another.



> [k2561] A toaster, a firm, a university, a horse, and a senator are
> all just fine and dandy, but when they become our toaster, firm,
> university, horse, and senator they are instantly finer and
> dandier. Studies such as these suggest that people are quite adept at
> finding a positive way to view things once those things become their
> own.



> [k2593] Analogously, when we face the pain of rejection, loss,
> misfortune, and failure, the psychological immune system must not
> defend us too well ("I'm perfect and everyone is against me") and must
> not fail to defend us well enough ("I'm a loser and I ought to be
> dead"). A healthy psychological immune system strikes a balance that
> allows us to feel good enough to cope with our situation but bad
> enough to do something about it ("Yeah, that was a lousy performance
> and I feel crummy about it, but I've got enough confidence to give it
> a second shot").


This is a very Popperian observation.


> [k2610] Scientists are credible because they draw conclusions from
> observations, and ever since the empiricists trumped the dogmatists
> and became the kings of ancient Greek medicine, westerners have had a
> special reverence for conclusions that are based on things they can
> see.



> [k2619] How do we manage to think of ourselves as great drivers,
> talented lovers, and brilliant chefs when the facts of our lives
> include a pathetic parade of dented cars, disappointed partners, and
> deflated soufflFIXMEfffd(C)s? The answer is simple: We cook the
> facts. There are many different techniques for collecting,
> interpreting, and analyzing facts, and different techniques often lead
> to different conclusions, which is why scientists disagree about the
> dangers of global warming, the benefits of supply-side economics, and
> the wisdom of low-carbohydrate diets. Good scientists deal with this
> complication by choosing the techniques they consider most appropriate
> and then accepting the conclusions that these techniques produce,
> regardless of what those conclusions might be.



> [k2626] Decades of research suggests that when it comes to collecting
> and analyzing facts about ourselves and our experiences, most of us
> have the equivalent of an advanced degree in Really Bad Science.



> [k2636] By controlling the sample of information to which they were
> exposed, these people indirectly controlled the conclusions they would
> draw.


One of the reasons I left the financial forecasting industry is
this tendency to control the data to suit the needs of the models.


> [k2677] This tendency to seek information about those who have done
> more poorly than we have is especially pronounced when the stakes are
> high. People with life-threatening illnesses such as cancer are
> particularly likely to compare themselves with those who are in worse
> shape, which explains why 96 percent of the cancer patients in one
> study claimed to be in better health than the average cancer
> patient. And if we can't find people who are doing more poorly than we
> are, we may go out and create them.



> [k2700] Although the word fact seems to suggest a sort of
> unquestionable irrefutability, facts are actually nothing more than
> conjectures that have met a certain standard of proof. If we set that
> standard high enough, then nothing can ever be proved, including the
> "fact" of our own existence. If we set the standard low enough, then
> all things are true and equally so.



> [k2777] We may refer to the processes by which the psychological
> immune system does its job as "tactics" or "strategies," but these
> terms--with their inevitable connotations of planning and
> deliberation--should not cause us to think of people as manipulative
> schemers who are consciously trying to generate positive views of
> their own experience. On the contrary, research suggests that people
> are typically unaware of the reasons why they are doing what they are
> doing,1 but when asked for a reason, they readily supply one.



> [k2875] Studies show that about nine out of ten people expect to feel
> more regret when they foolishly switch stocks than when they foolishly
> fail to switch stocks, because most people think they will regret
> foolish actions more than foolish inactions. But studies also show
> that nine out of ten people are wrong. Indeed, in the long run, people
> of every age and in every walk of life seem to regret not having done
> things much more than they regret things they did, which is why the
> most popular regrets include not going to college, not grasping
> profitable business opportunities, and not spending enough time with
> family and friends.



> [k2916] Indeed, research shows that when people are given electric
> shocks, they actually feel less pain when they believe they are
> suffering for something of great value.



> [k2919] If you've managed to forgive your spouse for some egregious
> transgression but still find yourself miffed about the dent in the
> garage door or the trail of dirty socks on the staircase, then you
> have experienced this paradox. Intense suffering triggers the very
> processes that eradicate it, while mild suffering does not, and this
> counterintuitive fact can make it difficult for us to predict our
> emotional futures.



> [k2970] Our failure to anticipate that inescapability will trigger our
> psychological immune systems (hence promote our happiness and
> satisfaction) can cause us to make some painful mistakes.



> [k3008] As we have seen, when experiences are unpleasant, we quickly
> move to explain them in ways that make us feel better ("I didn't get
> the job because the judge was biased against people who barf on Ferris
> wheels"). And indeed, studies show that the mere act of explaining an
> unpleasant event can help to defang it. For example, simply writing
> about a trauma--such as the death of a loved one or a physical
> assault--can lead to surprising improvements in both subjective
> well-being and physical health (e.g., fewer visits to the physician
> and improved production of viral antibodies).



> [k3053] Explanation robs events of their emotional impact because it
> makes them seem likely and allows us to stop thinking about
> them. Oddly enough, an explanation doesn't actually have to explain
> anything to have these effects--it merely needs to seem as though it
> does.



> [k3243] Memory's fetish for endings explains why women often remember
> childbirth as less painful than it actually was,12 and why couples
> whose relationships have gone sour remember that they were never
> really happy in the first place. As Shakespeare wrote, "The setting
> sun, and music at the close / As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest
> last / Writ in remembrance more than things long past."


I am not a fan of the bard.  I like Lao Tzu translations better,
because they are simpler and easier to follow.  It's a personal taste
thing.  Gilbert has either read a lot of Shakespeare, or he has a good
quote engine. 


> [k3270] Apparently, the way an experience ends is more important to us
> than the total amount of pleasure we receive--until we think about it.



> [k3318] It seems that our theories about how people of our gender
> usually feel can influence our memory of how we actually felt. Gender
> is but one of many theories that have this power to alter our
> memories.



> [k3329] Apparently students have the same theory, because research
> shows that when students do well on an exam, they remember feeling
> more anxious before the exam than they actually felt, and when
> students do poorly on an exam, they remember feeling less anxious
> before the exam than they actually felt. We remember feeling as we

> [k3343] Apparently, prospections and retrospections can be in perfect
> agreement despite the fact that neither accurately describes our
> actual experience.



> [k3347] We overestimate how happy we will be on our birthdays,26 we

> [k3389] Communication is a kind of "vicarious observation" that allows
> us to learn about the world without ever leaving the comfort of our
> Barcaloungers.



> [k3393] Yes, our ability to imagine our future emotions is flawed--but
> that's okay, because we don't have to imagine what it would feel like
> to marry a lawyer, move to Texas, or eat a snail when there are so
> many people who have done these things and are all too happy to tell

> average American moves more than six times, changes jobs more than
> ten times, and marries more than once, which suggests that most of
> us are making more than a few poor choices.



> [k3411] The philosopher Bertrand Russell once claimed that believing
> is "the most mental thing we do." Perhaps, but it is also the most
> social thing we do. Just as we pass along our genes in an effort to
> create people whose faces look like ours, so too do we pass along our
> beliefs in an effort to create people whose minds think like ours.



> [k3432] If a particular belief has some property that facilitates its
> own transmission, then that belief tends to be held by an increasing
> number of minds. As it turns out, there are several such properties
> that increase a belief's transmissional success, the most obvious of

> [k3455] False beliefs that happen to promote stable societies tend to
> propagate because people who hold these beliefs tend to live in stable
> societies, which provide the means by which false beliefs propagate.



> [k3463] Americans who earn $50,000 per year are much happier than
> those who earn $10,000 per year, but Americans who earn $5 million per
> year are not much happier than those who earn $100,000 per
> year. People who live in poor nations are much less happy than people
> who live in moderately wealthy nations, but people who live in
> moderately wealthy nations are not much less happy than people who
> live in extremely wealthy nations. Economists explain that wealth has
> "declining marginal utility," which is a fancy way of saying that it
> hurts to be hungry, cold, sick, tired, and scared, but once you've
> bought your way out of these burdens, the rest of your money is an
> increasingly useless pile of paper.



> [k3483] If no one wants to be rich, then we have a significant
> economic problem, because flourishing economies require that people
> continually procure and consume one another's goods and
> services. Market economies require that we all have an insatiable
> hunger for stuff, and if everyone were content with the stuff they
> had, then the economy would grind to a halt. But if this is a
> significant economic problem, it is not a significant personal
> problem.



> [k3489] Like so many thinkers, Smith believed that people want just
> one thing--happiness--hence economies can blossom and grow only if
> people are deluded into believing that the production of wealth will
> make them happy. If and only if people hold this false belief will
> they do enough producing, procuring, and consuming to sustain their
> economies.



> The pleasures of wealth and greatness ... strike the imagination as
> something grand and beautiful and noble, of which the attainment is
> well worth all the toil and anxiety which we are so apt to bestow upon
> it. ... It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual
> motion the industry of mankind. 



> [k3499] In short, the production of wealth does not necessarily make
> individuals happy, but it does serve the needs of an economy, which
> serves the needs of a stable society, which serves as a network for
> the propagation of delusional beliefs about happiness and
> wealth. Economies thrive when individuals strive, but because

> because holding it causes us to engage in the very activities that

> [k3512] Prospective parents know that diapers will need changing, that

The following had me rolling on the floor laughing

> my arm out of this freezing bucket and sticking my teenager's head in
