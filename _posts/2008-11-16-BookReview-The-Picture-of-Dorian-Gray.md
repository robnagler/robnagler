By Oscar Wilde, [Feedbooks.com](http://feedbooks.com), 1891

Oscar Wilde is a great author.  This book pulled me in like a
modern-day thriller, and held my attention (mostly).  Wilde has some
deep comments about society.  Even though th book is over 100 years
old, it speaks to me today -- lessons I have yet to learn.


> [k231] The aim of life is self-development.  To realize one's
> nature perfectly--that is what each of us is here for. People are
> afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all
> duties, the duty that one owes to one's self. Of course, they are
> charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own
> souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps
> we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of
> morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion--these are
> the two things that govern us. And yet--not been written for him."


 The beginning of the book raced along but some of the middle was
a bit too long-winded, filled with what I call "passage of time
paragraphs" such as this one:


> [k1847] And so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most
> exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered
> work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with
> gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings;
> the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East
> as "woven air," and "running water," and "evening dew"; strange
> figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books
> bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with
> fleurs-de-lis, birds and images; veils of lacis worked in Hungary
> point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work,
> with its gilt coins, and Japanese Foukousas, with their green-toned
> golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.



> [k2598] Lord Henry. "Every effect that one produces gives one an
> enemy. To be popular one must be a mediocrity."



> [k2795] Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin
> exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is
> rather lonely without her. Of course, married life is merely a habit,
> a bad habit. But then one regrets the loss even of one's worst habits.
> Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an essential part of
> one's personality."



> [k2878] As for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing as
> that. Art has no influence upon action. It annihilates the desire to
> act. It is superbly sterile. The books that the world calls immoral
> are books that show the world its own shame. That is all. But we won't
> discuss literature.
