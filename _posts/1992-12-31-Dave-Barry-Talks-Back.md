> [p127] People often become deranged by pets.  Derangement is the
> only possible explanation for owning a cat, an animial whose
> preferred mode of communication is to sink its claws three-quarters
> of an inch into your flesh.



> [p147] The taxpayers also cannot be relied upon to support
> performing arts usch as opera.  As a taxpayer, I am forced to admit I
> would rather undergo a vasectomy via a Weed Whacker that attend an
> opera. 



> [p167] The First Rule of Car Buying is one that I learned long
> ago from my father, namely: Never buy any car that my father would
> buy. [...] For example, my father was one of a very few Americans who
> bought he Hillman Minx, a wart-shaped British car with the same
> rakish, sporty appeal as a municipal parking garage but not as much
> pickup.  Our minx also had a Surprise Option Feature whereby the
> steering mechanism would disconnect itself at random moments, so
> you'd suddenly discover that you could spin the weheel all the way
> around in a playful circle without having any effect whatsoever on
> the front wheels. Ha ha!  You can imagine how I felt, as an insecure
> 16-year-old with skin capable of going from All-Clear Status to Fully
> Mature Zit in seconds, arriving at the big high school pep rally
> dance, where all the coll guys had their Thunderbirds and their GTOs
> with their giant engines and 23 carburetors, and there I was, at the
> wheel of: the Hillman Minx.  A car so technologically backward that
> the radio was still receiving Winston Churchill speeches.



> [p175] [Dave Barry appearing in night court for a traffic
> violation.]  Only there was no judge.  They herded us traffic
> violators into a courtroom with flags and a judge's bench and
> everything, but instead of an actual human, they had a judge
> _on_videotape_.  Really.  I could have just stayed home and _rented_
> the American system of justice.



> [p184] Some of you [alert readers] had excellent ideas for
> increasing government revenue, such as:[...]
> o "Fine people $50,000 for each unnecessary education-related letter
> attached at the end of their names.  For example, 'Robert H.
> Monotone, B.A., M.B.A., Ph.D.' would be fined $400,000 annually."



> [p208] Ultimately, however, anger benefits nobody.  If you keep it
> bottled up inside, it eats away at you, until eventually you turn
> into a bitter, spiteful, hate-ridden person working in Customer
> Service. 



> [p257] One of the gerat benefits of living in America is that,
> regardless of your race or religion or hygiene habits, you are
> entitled to have a credit rating maintained by large corporations
> with powerful computers that know _everything_about_you_.  For
> example, let's say that this morning you deposity your paycheck at
> the bank, made a phone call, wrote a check for your electric bill,
> and charged some gasoline with your credit card.  By this afternoon,
> thanks to high-speed laser fiber-optic data transmission, the
> computers will know _every_sexual-fantasy_you_had_ while you were
> doing these things.  And don't think they keep to themselves, either.
> They go to computer parties, they have a few too many diskettes, and
> the next thing you know they're revealing your intimate secrets at a
> rate of four billion per second. 



> That's why I was so excited about this offer from my credit-card
> company to sell me the TRW CREDENTIALS service.  TRW is a large
> company that collects credit information about people and sells it.
> According to the TRW CREDENTIALS offer, if I give theme $20 a year,
> they'll let me see my information.[...]



> In other words--correct me if I am wrong here--they're telling me
> that I should give them $20 a year so I can look at the information
> ABOUT ME that they have collected WITHOUT MY PERMISSION and have been
> selling for years to GOD ALONE KNOWS WHO so I can see if it's
> INCORRECT. 



> Which it very well could be.  Because even with computers, things
> sometimes go wrong.  I know you find this hard to believe, inasmuch
> as we live in such a competent nation, a nation capable of producing
> technological wonders such as the Hubble Orbiting Space Telescope,
> the only orbiting telescope in the universe equipeed with dark
> glasses and a cane.  But sometimes mistakes do get made, and they
> could affect your credit.[...]



> However, I don't like to do business with an outfit unless I know
> something about it.  So I've decided to develop a file on TRW.  I'd
> certainly appreciate anything you can contribute.  But I don't want
> any wild speculative unfounded rumers, such as:
> o TRW is the world's largest distributor of hard-core pornography.
> o TRW has destroyed two-thirds of the Earth's ozone layer.
> o TRW is a satanic vampire cult headed by the love chiled of Jim
> Bakker and Leana Helmsley.



> There is no need to run the rist that absurd statements such as
> these might get into print.  In fact, it would probably be a wised
> idea for TRW to examine my file, from time to time, just to make sure
> _nothing_inaccurate_ appeared in there.



> I'm sure we can work something out.
