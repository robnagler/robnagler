By Clive Stafford Smith, Nation Books, October 1, 2007, 1568583745

Clive Stafford Smith is a lawyer for
[Reprieve](http://www.reprieve.org.uk), which "provides frontline investigation and legal representation to
prisoners denied justice by powerful governments across the world,
especially those governments that should be upholding the highest
standards when it comes to fair trials."

The book is about Guantanamo, but Smith lets us know there are many
other secret prisons operated by the U.S., such as the one off the
island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.  The U.S. Government is
operating these prisons without oversight and against the Geneva
Conventions to which the U.S. is a party.  The prisons are holding
prisoners illegally and unquestionably torturing them.

There are even prisoners designated No Longer Enemy Combatants (NLECs)
by the U.S. Military itself are still being held, even though they
have acquitted by the military tribunals.  These prisoners were branded
the "worst of the worst" and "bad men" by the highest levels of the
U.S. Government, but they aren't and never were.  The majority were
sold by bounty hunters, like slaves at a market, for the princely sum
of $5,000 each, that's five or six years income for an ordinary
Pakistani.

The majority of the Guantanamo prisoners are innocent and fortunately
many have been set free, but some of the most abused are now
psychotic, and are still prisoners Tortured into psychosis by the
U.S. Military, and now the U.S. has to figure out what to do with
them.  No country will take them.

What's worse is that beyond Guantanamo, there are some 14,000
prisoners in U.S. custody or who have been transfered to 3rd parties
to be tortured.  Are they are innocent?  Were they arrested due to
some coerced confession by other prisoners?  A mountain of lies
created by the misguided idea that torture is necessary and can
extract useful and true information.

Smith enters into the torture debate by interviewing various people,
some who have freely admitted to forceful interrogations.  Others,
like Richard Perle & Alan Dershowitz, are academics who have never
tortured nor been interrogators, and approach the torture debate as a
theoretical exercise with the classic argument about the "ticking time
bomb".

Smith demonstrates the ticking bomb theory is irrelevant, because it
has never happened, and none of the reasons the U.S. or their proxies
are torturing people today has even the remotest connection with a
ticking bomb.  For the most part, it seems to me and Smith documents,
the torture has more to do with proving the guiltiness of those who
are being tortured or their non-compliance with irregular and brutally
enforced prison rules.

Needless to say that I'm horrified by Guantanamo.  Fortunately, I
didn't write this book, Smith did.  He writes well, clearly, and
unemotionally.  Given his secret clearance from the U.S. Government
and his many visits to Guantanamo, he also has knowledge that I do not
have, nor would be able to get.  I'm too emotional to be his position,
and I'm admire him greatly for fighting for justice for people who
have had all rights taken away from them.

> [p28] 'Now translate the issue of innocence into the context of

> erroneously, because we just got it wrong, before that invalidates the
> whole process of torture?' I asked.



> 'Well, I would think it would have to be a very small percentage, much
> smaller than the death penalty,' [Michael Levin, inventor of the
> ticking-time-bomb torture theory] said reflexively.



> 'So what you're saying is we're willing to torture fewer people who're

> tortured, but I'd rather that than being tortured to death. I had
> witnessed two clients die horribly in the electric chair.



> 'Many fewer, because torture's not a punishment, right? It's not a
> punishment, it's to prevent harm. And so you really, in that case, you
> have to be very, very sure that there's harm on the horizon.'



> That seemed a strained distinction. He had said he would hesitate

> lives. He wanted to be more careful about inflicting pain under those
> circumstances -- where innocent people suffer but they don't die --
> than he would be when society was executing a human and where history

> than with the death penalty. But where did that leave us on Levin's
> theory about the ticking time bomb, the cornerstone of his torture
> hypothesis?



> 'Can you identify, though, for me ...' I began. 'Can you identify one
> instance, say, in the last fifty years where torture was a real
> practical thing we could have done to avert a ... a massive disaster?'



> 'Well,' Levin pondered. 'I can't think of anywhere, with 20/20
> hindsight, we might be able to say -- well, they suspected these guys
> at the aeroplane gate, they were acting funny, if only we had known
> and we'd squeezed the information out of them right then and there,
> [p29] diverted the flights ... of course, you couldn't know that until

> So we had a theory, but it seemed to have no practical application.

> 'So it is a new rule?' Binyam wanted Kohlmann to admit that these were

> 'Mr Muhammad, there are rules of court, OK?' said Kohlmann, impatience
> now showing through. 'I can establish additional rules of court for

> 'OK, so we have a new rule, "No more signs in the court"?' Binyam
> said. 'Because I want to follow the rules. I don't want to be here and

> 'I am telling you as the Presiding Officer in charge of the proceeding

> 'OK, sir, that is a new rule,' Binyam concluded, obediently putting

> Binyam turned the conversation to what he would, and would not, be

> 30 April 2003, and expect there to be no challenges to it was risible.



> Kohlmann lectured Binyam on how he would not be allowed to talk in

> effort to appear accommodating was backfiring, as Binyam was proving
> far better prepared and more eloquent than the other prisoners who had
> appeared in earlier commission hearings. Some of them came from Yemen
> and Saudi Arabia, and barely spoke English. It was hard for them to
> control a courtroom since they were dependent on translators.



> 'You are also going to have to be guided by appropriate standards of
> civility.' Kohlmann said, laying down another rule about the times
> Binyam could speak in public, 'which, in my view, would not include
> ... the use of words like "crap" or "shit", OK? That is impolite
> conduct.'



> [p118] Joe and I were still sitting in the audience and it was
> difficult not to smile.



> Binyam had used the word 'crap' more than once. 'That is impolite,'
> Binyam repeated out loud, as if he were reflecting over the word. I
> sensed that he was considering how he had been 'impolitely' tortured
> for a couple of years.



> 'And you did all of those things just now and you need to stop doing
> that. Otherwise, you are not going to be allowed the leave that I have
> been granting you, OK? I will need to clamp down on that a little
> bit.'



> 'Let me have .. .' Binyam began, but Kohlmann was not going to let him
> back in yet.



> 'Don't use bad language,' Kohlmann re-emphasised. 'You can make your
> point, "I think the rules for the proceedings are absurd."  OK, that
> works just as well as "This is crap," OK?'



> I almost choked. Here was a quote out of the mouth of the colonel in
> charge of the tribunal -- 'I think the rules for the proceedings are
> absurd.'  Well put, I thought.



> 'So ...'



> 'And you seem like a rather articulate fellow to me and I think you
> can probably make your points without bad language.'



> 'Actually, Islam teaches us not to use bad language, but .. .'



> 'I didn't hear you.'



> 'Islam teaches us not to use bad language but sometimes I can't
> control, so it just comes out.'



> 'OK, well try.'



> 'I am trying to restrain myself as you are trying to restrain
> yourself, but I just ... I want to understand,' said Binyam, thinking
> he had allowed Kohlmann enough of the talking for a while. 'You say
> "impolite" and I think it is impolite to have a person tell you that
> people outside have lawyers who advise them and don't have to have
> them in the courtroom. And you say, "You know what, I don't care." I
> think that is impolite. I think you should say, "You know what, 1 have

> 'I will give you one minute here.' Kohlmann looked at his

> 'I don't need it.' Binyam looked down and started writing something,
> pointedly ignoring the colonel.



> [p150] Four years later the US had given up on the idea that Yusuf was

> [p156] I only learned that Sami had been found innocent on my next

> 'So when I was found innocent, what did the US military do?' he

> He was an [Not Enemy Combatant (NEC)] and, according to Navy Secretary
> England's promise, he deserved immediate release. Yet even when Sami
> told me what had happened I could not at once proclaim his right to be

> When I was eventually able to petition a court for his release, the
> Administration's response was bizarre: first their lawyers refused to

> changed his wicked ways. Under the law, we were told, Sami had no
> right to release, as an enemy combatant could still be held for the
> duration of the conflict, even if he was no longer dangerous.



> In August I complained loudly to the court about Sami, as he was still
> being held in Camp Five. So the military moved him to Camp Iguana,
> which had originally been constructed for the three Afghani juveniles,
> where conditions were far better. I was relieved that at least he was
> in a better place.



> Sami was released from Guantanamo to Egypt on 30 September 2005, a

> Sami al Laithi's case had been a rare one. He was one of just thirty

> [p177] At the end of November 2001 the war had already peaked and Sami

> It is not clear why he was initially stopped by the Pakistanis,

> Instead, Sami ended up in Guantanamo Bay.



> [p179] There was significant circumstantial evidence that the

> [p180] The missile seemed to have targeted the electric generator on

> st the background of this campaign against al-Jazeera, what rned about Sami's ongoing interrogation in Guantanamo was

> Afghanistan, with two agents posing as Saudi intelligence, to pretend
> [p240] that Abu Zubaydah had been flown to face the supposedly
> barbaric justice of Saudi Arabia. They expected Abu Zubaydah to
> tremble with fear when he discovered his 'rendition'.

> telephone numbers he had memorised for Prince Ahmed bin Salman bin
> Abdul Aziz, a nephew of King Fahd (and a racehorse owner whose horse War
> Emblem won the Kentucky Derby in 2002). To the amazement of the
> Americans, the numbers proved valid.
