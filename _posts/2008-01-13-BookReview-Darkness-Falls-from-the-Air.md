By Nigel Balchin, Cassell, 2002, 0304359696

Nigel Balchin wrote this during the WW II (1942) so it is almost
like a history novel, but it's an intriguing story about people during
stressful times (London Blitz).  It's a mixture of urgency and common
place.

> "They didn't actually ask for them," said Sutton. "But we want to hand

> "Oh, the Cabinet Office asked for them?"



> "No, no," said Sutton, getting a bit annoyed. "It's just a question of

> "Listen," I said. "Should I be right in saying that nobody's asked you

> "Not in so many words. But they might easily be wanted." 



> I said, "There's perhaps one chance in five hundred that the total

> "They might ask for details," said Sutton, a bit weakly.



> "Fine," I said. "Well, if they do, let me know and we'll get the

> I hung up and said, "There you are."



> "Don't really want them at all?" said Fred.



> "No."



> "Well, my God, when he rang me up you'd have thought the whole Cabinet
> was waiting for them with its tongue hanging out."  



> I said, "You always want to check up on Sutton. He's a nasty little
> pip-squeak, and he's always doing that sort of thing."



> "What for?"  



> "God knows. He likes to load the Minister up with a pile of papers two
> feet thick that he'll never read and wouldn't understand if he
> did. Then he reckons he's done a whale of a job."  



> "It takes a hell of a time too, that stuff." 



> "Of course it does. About half the place spends its time producing
> stuff that somebody important might want. That's why it's never got
> time to do its proper job. Go and take 'em off it Fred, and get them
> back on to the stuff for Wednesday."
