 The reference text on Refactoring.  I walked away with a true
appreciation for refactoring being the "engineering" aspects of
programming.  It's how you reduce complexity into simplicity.
You can refactor any piece of code, if you are a good engineer.


> [p53] *Refactoring* (noun): a change made to the internal

> [p387]Whereas applying (and possibly backing out) a series of
> incremental refactorings is fairly natural for Smalltalk and CLOS, the
> cost per iteration (in terms of recompilation and retesting) is higher
> in C++ programs; thus programmers tend to be less willing to make
> these small changes.
