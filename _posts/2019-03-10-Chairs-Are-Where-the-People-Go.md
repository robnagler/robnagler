By Misha Glouberman and Sheila Heti, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, July 5, 2011, 0865479453

I first heard about Misha Glouberman a few weeks ago when I listend to
[YANSS 143 - How to Talk to People About Things](http://n99.us/uty). It's
really interesting, and got me thinking about learning about
negotiation so I picked up his only book, which he dictated to his
friend and author, Sheila Heti, who is also a co-founder of
[Trampoline Hall](http://n99.us/czu), a unique monthly
lecture series in Toronto.

Misha Glouberman was a database programmer and then started doing
little art/class projects that eventually consumed his life. This book
covers that tale as well as many others. He doesn't understand how
people write books.

Sheil thought it was really important that Misha's thoughts be
documented, because he says such interesting things. I agree. She did
a great job. Misha talks in whole paragraphs, which I believe.

The book contains lots of emphasized words. I suspect that's because
it was dictated as well as the fact that Misha is a performance
artist.

There are short (a few paragraphs) and long (tens of pages)
essays. I like the format. It keeps you think and guessing. Sometimes
an essay is a single profound idea, and other times its about some
life episode that involves a lot of context.

One theme through the book is how Misha deals with where he lives in
Toronto. It's in the city in a neighborhood that's being gentrified
with bars where the hipsters go. He has some conflicted thoughts about
it, which made me think about things. Like, when you rich young people
want pedestrian zones, it's because they can afford it. Poor people
can't live in the city so have to commute to work by car. Rich
people's ideas about a city differ from what a city is about.

There's a lot of emphasis on improv and games. I like that. Such
things make me uncomfortable. Misha is not comfortable with it, which
is why he does it. I think he was too comfortable being a poor
programmer, now he's a (relatively) rich artist. There are thoughts
about this, too.

I enjoyed this book very much. I read it quickly for me, in a
week. Normally it can take me a month to read a book this long.

> [k55] Misha Glouberman is my very good friend.

> [k71] As you read the book, Misha may come off as this very

> [k87] It would be _overwhelming_ if you had to perceive every single

> [k140] A human who doesn't exist in a culture isn't somehow more
> true. In fact, I think a human who doesn't exist in a
> culture--that's not what a human is.

> [k173] This seems obvious, but a lot of the time, people will act
> out a charade in a way which would make perfect sense if you _knew_
> what the title was, but from which the title would be completely
> impossible to guess if you didn't know it.

> [k179] Some of the tips that apply to charades are the same tips you
> would apply to any improvisation: Be precise in your gestures. Be
> wholehearted. Don't forget to bring emotional content to what you
> do.

> [k235] It's a real service to have a leader, most of the
> time. Leaders do things that other people don't want to do, and
> which leaders _do_ want to do. They make the decisions. They're
> accountable for those decisions. They take the blame when things go
> wrong. They do a lot more of the work.

> [k250] I've put together a lot of shows, and if you talk to people
> after, you can always draw a pretty direct correlation between how
> much people liked the show and how close they sat to the stage.

> [k306] I think that's what art is: art is communication made in the
> hope that interesting miscommunications will arise.

> [k359] I did research online and I called a bunch of offices at the
> City. It was kind of amazing how impossible it was to get
> information.

> [k362] It was really discouraging, partly because I'd always assumed
> that the system ran a bit better than it does.

> [k558] I'm really interested in weaving the social and the musical
> together.

> [k570] For a while, I wrote a manners column for a magazine. On one
> level, manners is really just a tiny little subset of ethics. What
> having good manners is about is not making yourself more important
> than other people, which is what most ethics is about.

> [k618] The idea that improvisers would eliminate surprise from their
> own experience goes against my ideas about what's interesting about
> improvisation as a practice--and I'm much more interested in
> improvisation as a practice, or as something to do, than as
> something for people to watch.

> [k625] The idea that the point of art is to be impressive is--to
> me--_incredibly_ distressing.

> [k656] The way people laugh when they're taking an improv class
> together--the quality of laughter is so incredible and deep and real
> and serious. And it always feels to me that, in a way, comedy shows
> and funny movies are attempts to create a bottled version of
> that--of what happens with your friends when you're laughing and
> joking around.

> [k664] So what is true improv?
>
> I guess the biggest thing is that it's actually about letting
> yourself be surprised and letting yourself be off-balance.

> [k693] It's a funny paradox that one of the main things I do is
> teach people to improvise. I teach people, specifically, not to plan
> ahead, to be okay with not knowing what's coming next, to _hope_ to
> be surprised--but in the grand scheme of my life, I'm not very good
> at any of those things. Compared with most people, I think I worry a
> fair bit. I'm inclined to need control. I structure my time very
> carefully in a calendar.

> [k732] The best spam filtering software available, as far as I know,
> is SpamAssassin.

NOTE: Funny for me to read in the middle of a book about art. I've
done a lot of work with SpamAssassin and spam.

> [k866] But the end result is that it makes the university into an
> ivory tower--I mean, _incredibly_ so.

> [k868] In four years of living in that city I pretty much didn't
> come to know _anybody_ who wasn't affiliated with Harvard.

> [k873] So even at parties--and I went to parties for four years--the
> average number of people at a given party who weren't Harvard
> students was zero. All of this serves to create a very weird, very
> contained environment.

NOTE: Just watched Good Will Hunting again. In the bar scene it's a
Harvard bar where Will and his friends go to a Harvard bar to see what
it's like. They were outsiders. It resonated with this passage.

> [k923] But in Canada, if you went to Harvard, it's just sort of a
> weird novelty, a strange fact about you, like that you're a member
> of Mensa or you have an extra thumb.

> [k972] This just makes me nuts about people. It's as though there's
> this part of the human brain that allows us to perceive the moral
> failings and intellectual shortcomings of our enemies _so clearly_
> -- often even in cases where they don't even exist -- while at
> the same time being blind to the moral failings and intellectual
> shortcomings of our friends.

NOTE: There is a part of our brain that separates us from them. In

> [k1345] There's a pretty deep pleasure in that unison, in making the

> [k1377] I think a lot of what energizes a cocktail party is people's
> fear of being seen not talking to anyone.

> [k1464] The feeling I have before taking on any interesting project,
> especially teaching classes, is pretty much a feeling of terror and
> sickness.

> [k1470] I think a lot of art is about creating the illusion of ease,
> and I think it's great to enjoy that illusion, but I think it's
> great to know that it's an illusion, and I suspect--in my
> experience--the process of creating anything involves quite a lot of
> fear and difficulty, and it also involves covering up quite a lot of
> that fear and difficulty.

> [k1497] So when people say, _Why aren't your games more positive?_ I
> think it's funny, because niceness doesn't have to happen in a
> game. You should be nice in real life. You don't have to _play_ at
> niceness. You can just do it. Fighting is something to be minimized
> in real life.

> [k1560] It turns out that the best way to get people to communicate

> [k1584] It's hard for people sometimes to understand that things

> generate money.

> [k1620] The way I live now is pretty extravagant by the standards of

> [k1691] When we do Trampoline Hall, we put amateur speakers

> [k1725] Love is what happens between people living their lives

> it's what survives through difficulties and imperfections FIXME

> [k1846] It seems to me that the most pleasing thing you can find

> [k1942] The solution to impostor syndrome may not be in getting

> [k2134] I was _always_ smoking.

> Sometimes, I would be at a party and find myself reaching for a

> [k2152] And you can smoke everywhere.

> [k2184] The one thing that the smoking-cessation therapist said to

> [k2199] The books often tell you that when you're quitting smoking,

> [k2212] Now I'm sort of known for wearing suits.

> [k2214] But it's funny, because you sort of grow into wearing a
> suit, which is nice. It makes getting older a little easier.
