> [p5] This is just what the new model of programming does assume.
> Instead of hoping that people won't make mistakes, it tries to make
> the cost of mistakes very low.  The cost of a mistake is the time
> required to correct it.  With powerful languages and good programming
> environments, this cost can be greatly reduced.  Programming style
> can then depend less on planning and more on exploration.



> Planning is a necessary evil.  It is a response to risk: the more
> dangerous an undertaking, the more important it is to plan ahead.
> Powerful tools decrease risk, and so decrease the need for planning.
> THe design of your program can then benefit from what is probably the
> most useful source of information available: the experience of
> implementating it.



> [p5] Lisp style has evolved this way because it yields results.
> Strange as it sounds, less planning can mean better design.  THe
> history of technology is full of parallel cases. A similar change
> took place in painting during the fifteenth century.  Before oil
> paint became popular, painters used a medium, called _tempera_,
> that cannot be blended or overpainted.  THe cost of mistakes was
> hight, and this tended to make painters conservative.  Then came oil
> pant, and with it a great change in style.  Oil "allows for second
> thoughts." This proved a decisive advantage in dealing with difficult
> subjects like the human figure.



> [p6] More powerful tools are taking the risk out of exploration.
> That's good news for programmers, because it means we will be able to
> undertake more ambitious projects.  The use of oil paint certainly
> had this effect.  The period immediately following its adoption was a
> golden age of painting.  There are signs already that something
> similar is happening in programming.



> [p405] 112 The most horrible Lisp bugs may be those involving
> dynamic scope.  Such errors almost never occur in Common Lisp, which
> has lexical scope by default.
