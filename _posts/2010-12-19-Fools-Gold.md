Fool's Gold is yet another book about the 2008 meltdown. I didn't
finish it.  Too much drama and grandiosity.


> [k507] A few weeks after he had summoned Dennis Weatherstone and Peter
> Hancock to meet with him, in January 1992, Corrigan delivered a stern
> speech to the New York State Bankers Association. "Given the sheer
> size of the [derivatives] market," he said, "I have to ask myself how
> it is possible that so many holders of fixed-or variable-rate
> obligations want to shift those obligations from one form to the
> other." Translated from central bank jargon, this suggested that
> Corrigan was dubious about the banks' motives for making these
> deals. "Off-balance-sheet activities have a role," he continued, "but
> they must be managed and controlled carefully, and they must be
> understood by top management, as well as by traders and rocket
> scientists," he added. "I hope this sounds like a warning, because it
> is!"



> [k568] In 1992 and 1993, though, many investors thought it was worth
> taking those risks, by buying products with high leverage. "It was a
> type of crazy period," recalls T. J. Lim, one of the early members of
> the J.P. Morgan swaps team, who worked with Connie Volstadt in the
> 1980s and decamped with him to Merrill Lynch. "The herd instinct was
> just amazing. Everyone was looking for yield. You could do almost
> anything you could dream of, and people would buy it. Every single
> week somebody would think of a new product."



> Some prescient
> warnings were issued. Allan Taylor, the Royal Bank of Canada chairman,
> said that derivatives were becoming like "a time bomb that could
> explode just like the Latin American debt crisis did," threatening the
> world financial system. Felix Rohatyn, a legendary Wall Street figure
> who worked at Lazard Frers in corporate finance, far removed from
> derivatives, called derivatives "financial hydrogen bombs, built on
> personal computers by twenty-six-year-olds with MBAs."



> [k644] Brickell and the other members of ISDA were opposed to setting
> up a clearing system because they feared it would be the thin edge of
> a wedge of further regulations. They insisted that counterparty risk
> could be handled perfectly well by following the ISDA guidelines,
> posing some collateral against the risk of default, and just good
> smart trading. "The swap [market] framework is a model of market
> discipline," Brickell argued. "Within it, every participant
> scrutinizes the reputation and credit quality of his counterparties
> and adjusts the flow of his business accordingly."
