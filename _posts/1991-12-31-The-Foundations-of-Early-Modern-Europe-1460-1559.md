Good overview of the period.


> [p10] "The art of printing," [Pope Alexander VI] said, "is very
> useful insofar as it furthers the circulation of useful and tested
> books; but it can be very harmful if it is permitted to widen the
> influence of pernicious works.  It will therefore be necessary to
> maintain full control over the printers so that they wmay be

> the Catholic faith or which are likely to cause trouble to
> believers." 



> [p12] The achievement of the Swiss was to develop infantry tactics
> which permitted masses of unmounted troops to maneuver in the open
> field, defend themselves against cavalry charges, and engage in
> shock offensive action themselves. [...] By such means, men described
> with aristocratic disdain by a Milanese ambassador as "rude peasants
> who feed on cheese and curds" routed the chivalrous knights of the
> Burgundian dukes (at Morat in 1476) as efficiently as English yokels
> armed with longbows had defeated the mounted mobility of France at
> Cr\'ecy.



> [p54] Medieval theologians had commonly respected poverty,
> emphasized  the "glittering wretchedness" of wealth, an distrusted
> merchants.  St. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274) expressed perfectly the
> prejudices of peasants, artisans, and aristocrats when he wrote,
> "Properly speaking, commerce is condemned, for it encourages the
> passion for money [cupiditas lucri], which is without limit and
> almost infinite.  Therefore commerce, considered in itself, has
> something shameful and about it." [Summa theologiae, IIa IIae,
> quaest. LXXVII, art. 4.]



> [p71] [Talking about the origins of the trinity.] Both in the
> Vulgate (the Latin translation by St. Jerome, c. 340-420, which was
> authoritative in the Middle Ages and in the Roman Church) and in the
> King James version, the tex of I John 5:7-8 reads as follows: "And
> there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and
> the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.  And there are three that
> bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and
> these three agreen in one."  Erasmus proved the firts of these verses
> to be apocryphal.  He found it in no Greek manuscript.  It was
> missing in several of his oldest Latin manuscripts.  He discovered
> that it was unkown to any Christian writer before the fourth century.
> He argued, with perfect cogency, that if the tex _had_ exists, it
> would have surely have been quoted by orthodox writers in a period
> when the doctrine of the Trinity was the center of theological
> controversy; and he concluded--modern scholarship confirms him--that
> the textmust have been interpolated into the New Testament after the
> Council of Nicaea (325) in order to give biblical sanction to the
> Trinitarian formula adopted there.



> [p99] Renaissance princes were desperate for money.  Their largest
> expens was warfare. [..., p100] "No money, no Swiss" was a sixteenth
> century axiom."



> [p137] Anabaptists [...] read Matthew 5:34, "Swear not at all," and
> they obeyed.  This seemingly innocuous refusal to take oaths isolated
> them in a society accustomed to confirm by oath innumerable
> transactions and contract,s and placed them in a posture of civil
> disobedience, for Swiss and south German cities normally required
> their inhabitants to swear a yearly oath of obedience to the
> municipal authorities.  They read in Paul's Epistle to the
> Corinthians that Christians should not go to law, so they avoided
> lawyers and refused to got to court.  They read that the early
> Christians had held all property in common, and in order to conform



> [p138] to this New Testament standarde they broke the ooks on the
> doors of their houses and cellars an lovingly shared their goods with
> one another Some Anabaptists practiced evangelical communism.
> Because Christ said, "Resist not evil," and commanded Peter to put
> his sword into the sheath, Anabaptists were usually pacifists, and in
> the face of persecution, nonresistant.  "True Christian believers,"
> wrote Conrad Grebel, "are sheep among wolves, sheep for the
> slaughter; they must be baptized in anguish and affliction,
> tribulation, persecution, suffering , and death; they must be tried
> with fire, and must reach the fatheland of eternal rest, not by
> killing their bodily, but by mortifying their spiritual enemies.
> Neither do they use worldly sword or war, since all killing has
> ceased with them." [Spritual and Anabaptist Writers, ed. by G. H.
> Williams and A. M. Mergal (Library of Christan Classics, Vol. XXV,
> Philadelphia, 1961), p. 80]



> Revolutionary biblical literalism of this kind coulde lead to
> picturesque excess.  Some Anabaptists actually preached from the
> rooftops, or obeying Christ's command to become like little children,
> played and babbled like infants, or ran about naked because of a
> verse in Isaish, or practiced polygamy in imitation of the Old
> Testament patriarchs, or persuaded credulous women that it was
> impossible for them to be saved without sacrificing their virtue,
> for, they argued, the Lord said that only he who was willing to part
> with all he held most dear would enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  In
> 1532, demented by persecution, millenarian enthusiasm, and
> expectations of eschatological revenge, Anabaptists captured the
> episcopal city of M\"unster, in northwestern Germany, and briefly
> established a heavenly Jerusalem--communist, polygamous, and violent.



> [p139] Lutherans, Zwinglians, Calvinist, and Catholics all feared,
> detested, and persecuted the Anabaptists.



> [p143] The best-known paragraph in Loyola's _Spiritual_Exercises_
> (written 1522-1542) catches perfectly the commitment, passion , and
> discipline of mid-century Catholic militancy: "To arrive at complete
> certainty, this is the attitude of mind we should maintain: I will
> believe that the white object I see is black if that should be the
> decision of the hierarchical Church, for I believe that linking
> Christ our Lord the Bridegroom and His Bride the Church, there is one
> and the same Spirit, ruling and guiding us for our souls' good.  For
> our Holy Mother the Church is guided and ruled by the same Lpirit,
> the Lord who gave the Ten Commandments. [_The_Spiritual_Exercises_
> _of_Saint_Ignatius, trans. by Thomas Corbishley, S.J. (New York,
> 1963), p. 122.]



> [p150] In April 1525, Luther answered in his _Admonition_to_Peace:
> _A_Reply_to_the_Twelve_Articles_of_the_Peasants_in_Swabia.  The
> peasants, he said, had seriously misinterpreted the Gospel.  Their
> attitude was carnal, not spiritual.  They sought te give their
> enterprise an evangelical appearance, although in tfact their single
> purpose was to make their properties and bodies free.  His commentary
> on the article condemning serfdom struck bluntly home: "That in
> making Christian liberty an utterly carnal thing.  Did not abraham
> and other patriarchs and prophets have salves? ... Therefore this
> article is dead against the Gospel.  It is a piece of robbery by
> which every man takes from his lord the body, which has become his
> lord's property.  For a slave can be a Christian, and have Christian
> liberty, in the same way that a prisoner or a sick man is a
> Christian, and yet not be free.  This article would make all men
> equal, and turn the spritual kingdom of Christ into a worldly
> external kingdom." [Works_of_Martin_Luther, vol. IV (Philadelphia,
> 1931), p. 240.]



> [p151] This was not Luther's last word on the peasant war.  A month
> later, in May, he published his tract Against_the_Robbing_and_
> _Murdering_Hordes_of_Peasants, teh only unforgivably shameful thing
> he ever wrote.  He said the peasants were guilt of three sins:
> perjury, rebellion, and blasphemy.  "Therefore let everyone who can,
> smite, slay, and stab, sectretly or openly, remembering that nothing
> can be more poisonous, hurtful, or devilish than a rebel.  It is just
> as when one must kill a mad dog; if you do not strike him, he will
> strike you, and a whole land with you." [Ibid, p. 249] 



> Virtually without exception princes and nobles, secular and ly,
> Catholic and Lutheran, combined to crush the peasants.  The gruesome
> repression strengthened every despotic tendency in German political
> and social development.  At a crucial moment, the leaders of the new
> religion chose not the people, but the princes.  [One hundred
> thousand peasanst were killed as a result.]
