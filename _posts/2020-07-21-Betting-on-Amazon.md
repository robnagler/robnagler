In February, I dropped some Berkshire Hathaway in favor of
Amazon. When the market crashed in March due to COVID-19, I moved most
of my money into cash. Then as I gained confidence, I bought
more. Amazon is where most of my cash is invested.

If you read my 2014 article [Lazy Investing]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
post_url 2014-11-27-Lazy-Investing %}), you might say I am
contradicting myself. Actually, that article was an example of
confirmation bias. (I have that tendency, and perhaps this article
should poke more holes in my conclusion.) It took me five years to
realize that. I have to thank many lunch time conversations with Janis
and [Evan](https://evan.carlin.com) for challenging my convictions. I
also have to thank Warren Buffet for saying "You have to learn how to
value businesses and know the ones that are within your circle of
competence and the ones that are outside."

## The Richest Invested in One Company

In 2009, I wrote,
"[nine guys made all their money from a single company]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2009-06-13-Objectively-Rich %})."
These nine people were in top 25 on the Forbes Billionaires list.
Buffet, Helu, Alsaud, and Ka-shing were also in the top 25. And, the
other twelve inherited their wealth so I joked the "easiest path to
wealth is to inherit it." I concluded that I should invest with
Buffet, because he was the best money manager. That is, I assumed I
needed a money manager. Fatal flaw.

A better approach would have been to dig deeper. The people who
inherited their wealth _also_ made their money from a single
company. Even in the article, I noted that four of the top 25 were
Waltons, but I did not dig deeper. I should have.

The 2009 Forbes list:

1. William Gates III - Microsoft
2. Warren Buffett - Berkshire
3. Carlos Slim Helu - Grupo Carso
4. Lawrence Ellison - Oracle
5. Ingvar Kamprad - IKEA
6. Karl Albrecht - Aldi
7. Mukesh Ambani - Reliance
8. Lakshmi Mittal - ArcelorMittal
9. Theo Albrecht - Aldi
10. Amancio Ortega - Inditex
11. Jim Walton - Walmart
12. Alice Walton - Walmart
13. Christy Walton - Walmart
14. S Robson Walton	- Walmart
15. Bernard Arnault - Christian Dior & Le Bon Marche
16. Li Ka-shing Hong Kong - CK
17. Michael Bloomberg - Bloomberg
18. Stefan Persson - H&M
19. Charles Koch - Koch
20. David Koch - Koch
21. Liliane Bettencourt - L'Oreal
22. Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Alsaud - Kingdom Establishment
23. Michael Otto - Otto
24. David Thomson - Thomson-Reuters
25. Michael Dell - Dell

Every single one of these people got their wealth from companies
founded in the 20th century. No Rockefellers, Carnegies, or older
wealth is in the list. All the heirs are second generation, and many
went on to make the companies even bigger.

The list in 2020 contains even more first generation wealth from a
single company:

1. Jeff Bezos - Amazon
2. William Gates III - Microsoft
3. Bernard Arnault - Christian Dior & Le Bon Marche
4. Warren Buffett - Berkshire
5. Lawrence Ellison - Oracle
6. Amancio Ortega - Inditex
7. Mark Zuckerberg - Facebook
8. Jim Walton - Walmart
9. Alice Walton - Walmart
10. Rob Walton - Walmart
11. Steve Ballmer - Microsoft
12. Carlos Slim Helu - Grupo Carso
13. Larry Page - Google
14. Sergey Brin - Google
15. Liliane Bettencourt - L'Oreal
16. Michael Bloomberg - Bloomberg
17. Jack Ma - Alibaba
18. Charles Koch - Koch
19. Julia Koch - Koch
20. Ma Huateng - Tencent
21. Mukesh Ambani - Reliance
22. MacKenzie Bezos - Amazon
23. Karl Albrecht - Aldi
24. David Thomson - Thomson-Reuters
25. Phil Knight - Nike

Fun fact: about half the companies are retail and the other
half technology. Berkshire, Koch, and Gruppo Carso are outliers.

## Technology Meets Retail

Amazon used technology to sell retail, better. That's one reason
Amazon is the best bet. Retail is a huge industry: worldwide retail
sales are $24 trillion per year. People need to eat and to clothe
themselves. World income is rising, and along with it,
consumerism. (I'm not saying this is a good thing, but it is a hard
fact.)

Retail is a fickle business. I would not want to run a retail
business. You have to move with the trends. Amazon moves with the
trends. We are in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Amazon
stopped all deliveries of non-essential goods to its warehouses.
That's because at Amazon, [it is always Day 1](http://n99.us/ukg).

## Eat Your Own Dog Food

Technology is key to Amazon's success. Companies like Google and
Facebook, also became successful through technology. However,
technology at Amazon grew up around a problem: selling things. Then,
it grew into a thing on its own: Amazon Web Services. Neither Facebook
nor Google
[eats their own dog food](http://n99.us/exx)
like Amazon does. It's funny, when I searched for this Wikipedia
page I typed "Eat your own dog food" and the first completion on
Google was "Eat your own dog food Amazon".

Dogfooding is important. Google Compute Cloud is not used in
internally at Google whereas Amazon Web Services (AWS) is. If AWS is
down, services at amazon.com might be broken. I have used a number of
cloud providers, and none of the big ones work as well as AWS. (I do
like Linode.com, but they are a niche provider.)

## My Circle of Competence

Unlike Warren Buffet, I am a technologist. I understand why Amazon
made the decisions they made in their technology. I have friends who
have work(ed) at Amazon. I have started many different companies, and
I get what it takes to be a success. Dogfooding and Day 1 are key
concepts that I try to employ.

I interact with Amazon on a daily basis. I read on my Kindle every
day. I often watch Prime Video. I buy things for my home and
businesses on Amazon. I use Amazon Web Services. I listen to Amazon
Music, which I start by talking to Alexa via my Echo. I listen to
audio books on Audible. Buffet knows Dairy Queen and Coca-Cola, I know
Amazon. I've been a customer since 1998 when I moved back to the US.

But it's not just me: Amazon trucks past by my quiet street multiple
times a day. Amazon is an integral part of my society. And, more
importantly, we share [the same progressive values](http://n99.us/mjx)
while still believing in capitalism.

## What About Diversification?

In 2008, Warren Buffet made a ten year bet that the S&P 500 would beat
a hedge fund and
[the hedge fund manager conceded two years early](http://n99.us/noo). Buffet
says that non-professional investors should invest in low-cost index
funds. This is solid wisdom, and John C. Boggle made a fortune
creating that industry.

But right now, five companies make up more than 20% of the market
capitalization of the S&P 500. This is a problem for
diversification. The five are: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google,
Microsoft. So even if you invest in VOO or SPY, you are into tech, big
time.

Thinking about it differently, if you are 100% invested in the VOO,
you are 5% invested in Microsoft, 5% invested in Apple, etc. Those are
big investment decisions to make. If you are looking for
diversification, 5% is a big number. Moreover, Berkshire (number 6)
holds about 5% of Apple, which makes up 40% of its holdings right now
and growing.

I use Apple products, but I am not a fan of Apple as an
investment. They do sell retail, but they are focused on a narrow
range of products. It is hard for them to be agile. That's why I am
not betting on Apple, and why I didn't want +5% of my portfolio in
Apple.

Diversification is thought to be safe, but it leads to owning a lot of
Day 2 companies. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, and I would
not buy a single share of most of them. Why would do I think "in
aggregate" that the S&P 500 is a good bet? I don't, any more.

## Betting on America

Yes, I keep on bringing up Buffet. He's a brilliant investor, and he
has lived a long life with many ups and downs. Buffet says "Never,
ever bet against America." I agree.

That's why I am betting on Amazon. It is a quintessential American
company. The vast majority of its sales are in the US. Yet, they are
open for business in the world. Jeff Bezos is the richest man in
America. If America does well in the coming decade so will Amazon.

## One Horse Race

Walmart has been trying to compete with Amazon for a decade or more. I
have bought stuff from Walmart both on and offline. Walmart's revenues
($514B) are still bigger than Amazon ($280B). The difference is that
Walmart's growth has been under 10% for the last decade, and Amazon's
has been over 20%. Last quarter it grew by 34%.

There are other big companies, e.g. Apple, which are growing almost
that fast, Amazon is growing faster. It surpassed Apple this year, and
it is on track to surpassing Walmart in a couple of years.

Amazon's growth is diversified. It isn't just selling retail. AWS is
growing by over 30%, and it, too, is becoming more diversified. The
range of options on AWS is so mind boggling that a whole industry as
formed to help you manage AWS.

While this is, of course, confirmation bias, I have hard time seeing
where Amazon will falter. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Until them,
I'm betting on Amazon.
