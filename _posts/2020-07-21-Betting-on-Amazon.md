In February, I dropped some Berkshire Hathaway in favor of
Amazon. When the market crashed in March due to COVID-19, I moved most
of my money into cash. Then as I gained confidence, I bought
more. Amazon is where most of my cash is invested.

If you read my 2014 article [Lazy Investing]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
post_url 2014-11-27-Lazy-Investing %}), you might say I am
contradicting myself. Actually, that article was an example of
confirmation bias. (I have that tendency, and perhaps this article
should poke more holes in my conclusion.) It took me five years to
realize that. I have to thank many lunch time conversations with Janis
and [Evan](https://evan.carlin.com) for challenging my convictions. I
also have to thank Warren Buffet for saying "You have to learn how to
value businesses and know the ones that are within your circle of
competence and the ones that are outside."

In this article, I attempt to value Amazon, because I believe it is
within my circle of competence to do so. I want to know if my bet on
Amazon makes sense.

## Bucking Tradition

Some investment advisors would have me put
[60% of my money in bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/062714/100-minus-your-age-outdated.asp)
and the rest in stock. Others say 110 minus your age in stocks, or
50%, in my case. I think formulas like this are ridiculous, and not
based on actual circumstances.

For example, I own real estate. How much is it worth? Real estate is a
leveraged investment. What should my leverage be at my age? Some
people would say I should be paying off your mortgage before I
retire. None of this is incorporated in the age-based calculations.

"Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund," [Warren Buffet]
[told CNBC's On The Money](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/03/why-warren-buffett-says-index-funds-are-the-best-investment.html).
"I think it's the thing that makes the most sense practically all of
the time."

If you have a long horizon, this makes perfect sense. Perhaps if I
hadn't put all my savings into myriad startups, I'd have more savings
now, and a bet on the S&P would have paid off. However, I have less
savings than I need to retire, and I am confident that 1) I can work
till I'm 75 and/or 2) I can take on much more risk so I might
not have to.

I do have real estate in a solid market, and depending on whom you
ask, it makes up 40% of my portfolio. I am also 15% cash at this
very moment due to COVID-19, but that will change.

## Technology Meets Retail

Amazon used technology to sell retail, better. That's one reason
Amazon is the best bet. Retail is a huge industry: worldwide retail
sales are $24 trillion per year. People need to eat and to clothe
themselves. World income is rising, and along with it,
consumerism. (I'm not saying this is a good thing, but it is a hard
fact.)

Retail is a fickle business. I would not want to run a retail
business. You have to move with the trends. Amazon moves with the
trends. We are in the middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Amazon
stopped all deliveries of non-essential goods to its warehouses.
That's because at Amazon, [it is always Day 1](http://n99.us/ukg).

## Eat Your Own Dog Food

Technology is key to Amazon's success. Companies like Google and
Facebook, also became successful through technology. However,
technology at Amazon grew up around a problem: selling things. Then,
it grew into a thing on its own: Amazon Web Services. Neither Facebook
nor Google
[eats their own dog food](http://n99.us/exx)
like Amazon does. It's funny, when I searched for this Wikipedia
page I typed "Eat your own dog food" and the first completion on
Google was "Eat your own dog food Amazon".

Dogfooding is important. Google Compute Cloud is not used in
internally at Google whereas Amazon Web Services (AWS) is. If AWS is
down, services at amazon.com might be broken. I have used a number of
cloud providers, and none of the big ones work as well as AWS. (I do
like and use Linode.com, but they are a niche provider.)

Microsoft were the
[original dogfooders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food#Origin_of_the_term).
This made Windows more reliable. I wonder if they are dogfooding
their cloud products. From my personal usage of Azure (Microsoft's AWS
competitor), I would say
not, even though Microsoft is Number Two in cloud computing. Azure is
clunky to use, and I only know a few people who use it.

## Cloud Computing Revenues

Investors pay a lot of attention to The Cloud. I'm less interested,
because it is a small part of Amazon's revenue. AWS revenue was $35B
in 2019, if we take it as face value. It grew from $25B in 2018, and
is on track to increase by that much again in 2020. Amazon's total
revenue in 2018 was $233B, and rose to $281B in 2019. That's 20%
growth in a much larger market ($24T). Yet, I know that investors pay
attention so should I.

One question I had is whether AWS recognizes revenue from, say, Prime
Video. Reading the 10-K, says "Costs to operate our AWS segment are
primarily classified as 'Technology and content' as we leverage a
shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology
requirements and external sales to AWS customers." I take from this
statemtnt that they treat "internal technology" as a cost, and not a
cost of goods sold. I don't think it would be legal for them to
recognize revenue from internal "sales", and enough people are
watching that I feel safe in that assumption.

Investors are very excited about Microsoft, which has a higher market
cap than Amazon, despite having only $126B in revenue in 2019 and
$110B in 2018. Growth at Microsoft has been less than 15%. It's
strange to me that their market cap is so high. The big excitement
in the news is Azure growth, but there's a
problem: Microsoft is
[hiding Azure revenue numbers](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-keeps-hiding-azure-revenue-numbers-but-why/).

Azure revenues are important, because I would like to know if AWS is
far and away the biggest cloud service, or if competitors are eating
into AWS's revenue. Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment includes
Azure, GitHub, Windows Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio, and
Enterprise Services (Consulting and Support). Intelligent Cloud
revenues were $39B in 2019. However, no one seems what Azure's
standalone revenues are.

I tried to do my own analysis, and gave up. Microsoft keeps on
recategorizing "commercial cloud" to mean something else, and it seems
to be getting bigger. (Go to the 2017 and 2019 annual reports and
search on "Revenue from external customers" to see what I mean.)

However, I am pretty sure that Azure revenues are a small percentage of the
$39B stated in 2019 for the same reason that Amazon didn't post
seperate numbers for AWS's first nine years. Small numbers are not
interesting to investors. If Azure growth is 72%, it's not on $10B,
because the delta between 2018 and 2019 Server Products and Cloud
Services is $6B.

My conclusion is that Microsoft is not eating AWS's lunch, at least
not yet.

## My Circle of Competence

Unlike Warren Buffet, I am a technologist. I understand why Amazon
made the decisions they made in their technology. I have friends who
have work(ed) at Amazon. I have started many different companies, and
I get what it takes to be a success. Dogfooding and Day 1 are key
concepts that I try to employ.

I interact with Amazon on a daily basis. I read on my Kindle every
day. I often watch Prime Video. I buy things for my home and
businesses on Amazon. I use Amazon Web Services. I listen to Amazon
Music, which I start by talking to Alexa via my Echo. I listen to
audio books on Audible. Buffet knows Dairy Queen and Coca-Cola, I know
Amazon. I've been a customer since 1998 when I moved back to the US.

But it's not just me: Amazon trucks past by my quiet street multiple
times a day. Amazon is an integral part of my society. And, more
importantly, we share [the same progressive values](http://n99.us/mjx)
while still believing in capitalism.

## What About Diversification?

In 2008, Warren Buffet made a ten year bet that the S&P 500 would beat
a hedge fund and
[the hedge fund manager conceded two years early](http://n99.us/noo). Buffet
says that non-professional investors should invest in low-cost index
funds. This is solid wisdom, and John C. Boggle made a fortune
creating that industry.

But right now, five companies make up more than 20% of the market
capitalization of the S&P 500. This is a problem for
diversification. The five are: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google,
Microsoft. So even if you invest in VOO or SPY, you are into tech, big
time.

Thinking about it differently, if you are 100% invested in the VOO,
you are 5% invested in Microsoft, 5% invested in Apple, etc. Those are
big investment decisions to make. If you are looking for
diversification, 5% is a big number. Moreover, Berkshire (number 6)
holds about 5% of Apple, which makes up 40% of its holdings right now
and growing.

I use Apple products, but I am not a fan of Apple as an
investment. They do sell retail, but they are focused on a narrow
range of products. It is hard for them to be agile. That's why I am
not betting on Apple, and why I didn't want +5% of my portfolio in
Apple.

Diversification is thought to be safe, but it leads to owning a lot of
Day 2 companies. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, and I would
not buy a single share of most of them. Why would do I think "in
aggregate" that the S&P 500 is a good bet? I don't, any more.

## Betting on America

Yes, I keep on bringing up Buffet. He's a brilliant investor, and he
has lived a long life with many ups and downs. Buffet says "Never,
ever bet against America." I agree.

That's why I am betting on Amazon. It is a quintessential American
company. The vast majority of its sales are in the US. Yet, they are
open for business in the world. Jeff Bezos is the richest man in
America. If America does well in the coming decade so will Amazon.

## One Horse Race

Walmart has been trying to compete with Amazon for a decade or more. I
have bought stuff from Walmart both on and offline. Walmart's revenues
($514B) are still bigger than Amazon ($280B). The difference is that
Walmart's growth has been under 10% for the last decade, and Amazon's
has been over 20%. Last quarter it grew by 34%.

There are other big companies, e.g. Apple, which are growing almost
that fast, Amazon is growing faster. It surpassed Apple this year, and
it is on track to surpassing Walmart in a couple of years.

Amazon's growth is diversified. It isn't just selling retail. AWS is
growing by over 30%, and it, too, is becoming more diversified. The
range of options on AWS is so mind boggling that a whole industry as
formed to help you manage AWS.

While this is, of course, confirmation bias, I have hard time seeing
where Amazon will falter. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Until them,
I'm betting on Amazon.
