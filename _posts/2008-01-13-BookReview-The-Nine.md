By Jeffrey Toobin, Doubleday, September 18, 2007, 0385516401

Jeffrey Toobin turns a boring subject into an exhilirating read.
It's a hitory book without footnotes, which often distract me from the
story part of history.  Toobin dives into the Rehnquist court, which
was far less conservative than the political makeup of the court would
lead you to believe.

I haven't read The Brethren by Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong yet.
After reading Toobin's book, I'm not sure I would.  Toobin explains
how the court works in enough detail that I would probably find The
Brethen to be a bit much.  While it wasn't a slog to get through --
on the contrary, it was a fast read -- it was enough about the Supreme
Court for me.

Toobin covers the people brilliantly.  I love how he paints their
personalities into each case.  I cringed when I read about the 2000
election fiasco, and I lived through Souter's pain after the verdict.
The court was at a low point during that decision.

He ends on an interesting and upbeat point:


> [p340] But the Court is a product of a democracy and represents, with
> sometimes chilling precision, the best and the worst of the people.
> We can expect nothing more, and nothing less, than the Court we
> deserve.



> [p142] Goldwater believed in small government and states'
> rights, but he never signed on for expressions of public piety and
> regulation of private conduct. Neither, for the most part, did
> O'Connor. (And she always remembered Goldwater's salty response to
> Jerry Falwell's assertion that "good Christians" should be wary of
> O'Connor's nomination. "I think every good Christian ought to kick
> Falwell's ass," the senator said.)



> [p173] Kennedy responded by adding what became the most notorious
> senrence in the opinion-indeed, a single senrence that summed up so
> much of what was wrong with what the Court did. "Our consideration is
> limited to the present circumstances," Kennedy wrote, "for the problem
> of equal protection in election processes genetally presents many
> complexities."  



> In other words, the opinion did nor reflect any general legal
> principles; rarher the Court was acting only to assist a single
> individual -- George W. Bush. That was not what Kennedy meant, but that
> was what he wrote.  The sentiment amounted to a natural consequence of
> the Court's misbegotten encounter with the 2000 elecrion. The business
> of the Supreme Court is to take cases that establish principles of
> general application. But as Kennedy's sentence all but conceded, there
> was no general principle in _Bush_v._Gore_ -- only a specific designation
> of the winner of one election. More than any other, this sentence
> invited skepticism about the majority's true motives in the case.  



> [p176] There was only one bright Spot in this dismal panorama. John
> Paul Stevens's dignified, clearheaded, and insistent eloquence honored
> the Court. Alone among the justices, Stevens was consistent and
> logical and constitutionally sound in his thinking. From his home in
> Fort Lauderdale, he composed a peroration that serves as the best
> epitaph for this sorry chapter in the Court's history: "The [per
> curiam opinion] by the majority of this Court can only lend credence
> to the most cynical appraisal of the work of judges throughout the
> land. It is confidence in the men and women who administer the
> judicial system that is the true backbone of the rule of law. Time
> will one day heal the wound to that confidence that will be inflicted
> by today's decision. [p177] One thing, however, is certain. Although
> we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner
> of this year's Presidential election, the identity of the loser is
> pellucidly clear. It is the Nation's confidence in the judge as an
> impartial guardian of the rule of law." (At the last moment, one of
> Stevens's clerks prevailed on him, just this once, to give up his
> favorite word -- _pellucidly_ -- and substitute the more familiar
> _perfectly_, which is how the famous sentence now reads.)

> David Souter alone was shattered. He was, fundamentally, a very
> different person from his colleagues. It wasn't just that they had
> immediate families; their lives off the bench were entirely unlike
> his. They went to parties and conferences; they gave speeches; they
> mingled in Washington, where cynicism about everything, including the
> work of the Supreme Court, was universal. Toughened, or coarsened, by
> their worldly lives, the other dissentets could shrug and move on, but
> Souter couldn't. His whole life was being a judge. He came from a
> tradition where the independence of the judiciary was the foundation
> of the rule of law. And Souter believed _Bush_v._Gore_ mocked that
> tradition. His colleagues' actions were so transparently, so crudely
> partisan that Souter thought he might not be able to serve with them
> anymore.  



> Souter seriously consideted resigning. For many months, it was not at
> all clear whether he would remain as a justice. That the Court met in
> a city he loathed made the decision even harder. At the urging of a
> handful of close friends, he decided to stay on, but his attitude
> toward the Court was never the same. There were times when David
> Souter thought of _Bush_v._Gore_ and wept.



> [p339]  Fot rhis reason, Breyer's wan longing for Stare decisis will
> stir few heartS. Breyer and his liberal colleagues (joined on this
> occasion by Kennedy) did nor care abour state decisis when they voted
> in Lawrence v. Texas to overrurn the Courr's barely seventeen-year-old
> decision in Bowers v. Hardwick. Rather, rhey believed that the rime

> Still, when it comes to the incendiary political issues that end up in
