This book was mentioned in the bib Extreme Programing 2 ed.  I tried
some of the ideas out, and some worked, but many didn't.  I'm not
convinced you get past the "Little Adult" assumption by assuming kids
are motivated intrinsically from the start. The book is
thought-provoking, however.

The main theme is that external (dis)incentives don't internalize
motivation in children (or adults).  Extrinsic motivation stays
external, and when eliminated, sometimes causes worse performance than
before it was introduced.  Random rewards work better than constant
rewards.  Group rewards can penalize non-performing members.  In
summary, intrinsic motivation is hard, and shortcuts don't help.


> [p231] punishment teaches about the use of power, not about how or why to

> If we dig still further, we find that this perception upsets us for

> has been challenged, and the more we construe a relationship as a
> battle for power, the more wildly we will lash out to preserve that
> power. Second, we are concerned the child will come away thinking he
> can repeat whatever it was he did. This concern, in turn, betrays a
> particular assumption about children's motives, namely that a child
> is inclined to do what he can get away with and will keep doing it
> until forcibly restrained. Ultimately, our need to punish (or dread of
> not punishing) is predicated on a tacit theory of human nature.



> [p239] Children are more likely to grow into caring people if they

> is the sine qua non of positive development. (It also turns out to
> be useful for the more limited goal of getting children to do what we

> mistakes, learn to trust, share their feelings, and grow.  If they
> are taken seriously, they can respect others.   If their emotional needs
> are met, they have the luxury of being able to meet other people's
> needs. Deprived of these things, however, they may spend their lives
> doing psychological damage control.



> [p243] Attributing to a child the best possible motive that is
> consistent with the facts may set in motion another of those "auspicious"
> circles. We help children develop good values by assuming whenever
> possible that they are already motivated by these values, rather than
> by explaining an ambiguous action in terms of a sinister desire to
> make our lives miserable.
