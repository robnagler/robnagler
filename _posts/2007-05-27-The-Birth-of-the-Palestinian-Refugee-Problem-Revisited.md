This classic text was revised without a thematic change.  Other
books have come out which shed light on Plan Dalet, which is arguably
the cause of the Palestinian Refugee problem.  It's a thick book, but
it fails to convince.  The conclusion is a fiat, not proven thesis:


> [p588] The first Arab-Israeli war, of 1948, was launched by the
> Palestinian Arabs, who rejected the UN partition resolution and
> embarked on hostilities aimed at the preventing the birth of Israel.
> That war and not design, Jewish or Arab, gave birth to the Palestinian
> refugee problem.
