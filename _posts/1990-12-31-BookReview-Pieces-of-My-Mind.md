> You can go into a strange restaurant and make a good guess about
> how the food is going to taste long before they've actually served you

> meal is going to be.



> This idea can be extended to everything and everybody.  You can
> tell a lot about the whole from a small part.  You can tell a lot
> about how a person does everything from watching him or her do just
> one thing.  we are all victims of our own character and we find it
> impossible to do something that isn't characteristic of us. 



> This idea applies to whole countries just as certainly as it

> Germans keep doing things like Germans, the French like the French.



> The President said the other night that the Soviet Union has ``a
> definite margin of superiority'' over the United States in nuclear
> arms.  Using my theory about being able to tell a lot from a sample,
> I doubt it.  I've spent a good deal of time in Russia and hold some
> opinions about the people and the nation that no one can talk me out
> of. 



> One of my firmly held beliefs is that the Russians are not
> naturally mechanical people.  They may acquire the ability and the y
> may be better at it than they used to be but working with machinery
> does not come naturally to the average Russian.  They have a great
> heritage in music and literature and the arts in general but they
> build terrible automobiles and don't know how to fix them when they
> break down. 



> One of the most incredible travel experiences I've ever had is a
> week in a Russian hotel in Moscow.  The second time I stayed there
> they had installed telephones in every room but the telephones were
> not connected through any hotel switchboard.  There was no way for
> anyone to call the hotel and be connected ith me by phone in my room.
> It had a number just like any other telephone in a home in Moscow.



> Does this sound like a country that is apt to be ahead of us in
> nuclear weapons?



> The Russians, in their desparate attempt to get hard, Western
> currency away from tourist, opened what they call ``Dollar Stores.''
> They put their best merchandise in these small shops located in their
> best hotels and offer it for sale in exchange for dollars, not
> rubles.  Russian citizens can't buy there.



> I've bought nail clippers, razors, razor blades and ballpoint pens
> in those dollar stores and I've carefully inspected such items as
> cameras, camera lenses, binoculars, cigarette lighters, scissors and
> watches there.   The best Russian goods are poor by our standards.
> The workmanship is inferior and the design is either imitative or
> just bad.



> This isn't being written by some blindly anti-Russian nut.  I don't
> hate the Russians.  I hate their oppressive government.  As a matter
> of fact, I kind of like the Russians.  They're often wonderfully
> free-spirited and fun to be with but, for whatever facet of their
> national character it is, they do a lot of things badly.  From what
> I've seen of their binoculars and their ballpoint pens, I'd guess
> nuclear weapons would be one of the things they make poorly.  There
> are things Americans don't do well, either, but these are different
> things. 



> Obviously the Russians have learned how to do some things. Their
> space programs is not as sophisticated as ours but it works.  I have
> no doubt that their nuclear bombs go off with a big bang and I'm also
> sure they've built rockets that will take their missiles to New York.
> What I can't believe, from what I know firsthand about the Russians,
> is that they have more and better nuclear weapons that we do.



> I can't help myself from thinking that the President is just trying
> to scare us into approving a huge defense budget.  If the Russians
> could build great nuclear bombs, their hotels wouldn't be as poorly
> constructed as they are.  I go into a place for a week and judge a
> whole country by one hotel.  The Russians would be accurate in saying
> that's the kind of person I am.
