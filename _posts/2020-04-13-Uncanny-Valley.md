By Anna Wiener, Picador, January 5, 2021, 1250785693

A well-written, funny, and thought-provoking book. I connected with
many of her views on the tech industry. She articulates them so well
with really clever wording. For example, she never names companies,
but uses Rowling's he-who-must-not-be-named, e.g. "the social network
everyone hated".

Weiner's memoir is full of self-discovery. It's always hard to tell
how much is real and made up, but it rings true to me. Do you want
money and things or work with meaning? That's something we all go
through, and she documents her thought process. She's a writer so she
must have kept a journal, because the book contains a lot of details,
which I enjoyed.

What did she end up doing? Leaving the tech industry, and now she now
writes about it. I guess it's a tension that helps her be
creative.

Definitely a fun read, especially if you are techie like me.
