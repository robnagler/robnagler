By David Byrne, Viking Adult, September 17, 2009, 978-0670021147

When I think of David Byrne, I think of The Talking Heads.  This book
has changed that view completely.  I now think of him as a World
Citizen.  He seems like an amazing person.  And, he's more than a
musician.  The book is very well written.

I would never have thought of him as a bike commuter.  He thinks of
bikes as a means of transport and a way of keeping sane, which is
the way I think of biking and why I started
[Freiker](http://freiker.org) (now
[Boltage](http://boltage.org) and
[KidCommute](http://kidcommute.org)).

Byrne not only rides around town, he takes a folding bike with him
when he travels, and rides around the cities he visits.  This book is
structured around these visits, but it's much larger than that.

Needless to say, I enjoyed this book immensely.  I found myself over
and over again saying "I totally agree with that."  Byrne also takes
me places I wouldn't visit on my own.  He also presents ideas about
art that are new to me.  He got me in the door with the biking bit,
and taught me much more as a result.  Thanks, Mr Byrne!

I like the way he speaks about music. He understands music at a
very deep level as it is connected to culture.

This begins a fascinating section on biking as transport.

Byrne strikes me as a Real New Yorker(tm): impatient and
aggressive in that NY way.  Not in your face, but willing to ride your
bike around a town that is ruled by taxis, limos, and other crazy NY
drivers.

I totally identify with this idea. However I run stop signs in
Boulder if no one is there. I won't run red lights. I get frustrated
when I'm stopping for a stop sign and motorists are trying to be
courteous by signaling me to ride through. It confuses things, because
you often can't see their signaling. Too many riders assume they have
the right of way when they don't crating problems for traffic flow in
general.

> [k3534] Here are more of Pealosa's thoughts, from a piece he wrote

> you're rich or because you have a Ph.D., but because you are human."
> If people are treated as special, as sacred even, they behave that
> way. This creates a different kind of society.



> [k3549] Pealosa tends to link equality, in all its forms, with
> democracy--a connection that is anathema to many in the United
> States. In his words, "In developing-world cities, the majority of
> people don't have cars, so I will say, when you construct a good
> sidewalk, you are constructing democracy. A sidewalk is a symbol of
> equality. . . . If democracy is to prevail, public good must prevail
> over private interests." He goes on to say, "Since we took these steps
> [in Bogota], we've seen a reduction in crime and a change in attitude
> toward the city." I can see why. When there are constantly people on
> the streets the streets are automatically safer.



> [k3570] Since the onslaught of the automobile in the middle of the
> last century, and the efforts of its enablers, like Robert Moses in
> New York, the accepted response to congestion has been to build more
> roads, especially roads that are high speed and with limited
> access. Eventually it became clear that building more roads doesn't
> actually relieve congestion--ever. More cars simply appear to fill
> these new roads and more folks imagine that their errands and commutes
> might be accomplished more easily on these new expressways. Yeah,
> right. People end up driving more, so instead of the existing traffic
> levels remaining constant and becoming dispersed on the new ribbons of
> concrete, the traffic simply increases until those too are
> filled. That's what New York and a lot of other cities are realizing
> now. The old paradigm is finally being abandoned.



> [k3645] I'm in my midfifties, so I can testify that biking as a way of
