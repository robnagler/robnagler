Excellent book about life in America.  Steinbeck took a three month
trip across America in his camper with his standard poodle Charley.
He describes the scenary and people.


> [p4] A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike.  And
> all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless.  We find
> after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us.
> Tour masters, schedules, reservations, brass-bound and inevitable,
> dash themselves to wreckage on the personality of the trip.  Only
> when this is recognized can the blown-in-the-glass bum relax and go
> along with it.  Only then do the frustrations fall away.   In this a
> journey is like marriage.  The certain way to be wrong is to think
> you control it.  I feel better now, having said this, although only
> those who have experienced it will understand it.



> [p6] Furthermore, two or more people disturb the ecologic complex
> of an area.



> [p7] A projected journey spawns advisers in schools.



> [p9] A man who seeing his mother starving to death on a path kicks
> her in the stomach to clear the way, will cheerfuly devote several
> hours of his time giving wrong directions to a total stranger who
> claims to be lost.



> [p10] They spoke about, free and unanchored, not toward something
> but away from something.  I saw this look and heard this yearning
> everywhere in every state I visited.  Nearly every American hungers
> to move.



> [p11] Also I laid in a hundred and fifty pounds of those books one
> hasn't got around to reading--and of course those are the books one
> isn't ever going to get around to reading.



> [p21] I wish I could like submarines, for then I might find them
> beautiful, but they are designed for destruction, and while they may
> explore and chart the sea bottom, and draw new trade lines under the
> Arctic ice, their main purpose is threat.  And I remember too well
> crossing the Atlantic on a troop ship and knowing that somewhere on
> the way the dark things lurked searching for us with their
> single-stalk eyes.  Somehow the light goes bleak for me when I see
> them and remember burned men pulled from the oil-slicked sea.  And
> now sumbarines are armed with mass murder, our sill, only way of
> deterring mass murder.



> [p34] Early-rising men not only do not talk much to strangers,
> they barely talk to one another.  Breakfast conversation is limited
> to a series of laconic grunts.  The natural New England taciturnity
> reaches its glorious perfection at breakfast.



> [p39] [I]n our time a beard is the one thing a woman cannot do
> better than a man, or if she can her success is assured only in a
> circus. 



> [p43] I can never get used to the thousands of antique shops along
> the roads, all bulging with authentic and attested trash from an
> earlier time.  I believe the population of the thirteen colonies was
> less than four million souls, and every one of them must have been
> frantically turning out tables, chairs, china, glass, candle molds,
> and oddly shaped bits of iron, copper, and brass for future sale to
> twentieth-century tourists.



> [p46] Strange how one person can saturate a room with vitality,
> with excitement.  Then there are others, and this dame was one of
> them, who can drain off energy and joy, can suck pleasure dry and get
> no sustenance from it.



> [p84] I find out of long experience that I admire all nations and
> hate all governments, and nowhere is my natural anarchism more
> aroused than at national borders where pationt and efficient public
> servants carry out their duties in matters on immigration and
> customs.



> [p90] When we get these thruways across the whole country, as we
> will and must, it will be possible to drive from New York to
> California without seeing a single thing.



> [p106] I who love words and the endless possibility of words am
> saddened by [the uniformity of speech across th nation] this
> inevitability.  For with local accent will disappear local tempo.
> The idioms, the figures of speech that make language rich and full of
> the poetry of place and time must go.  And in their place will be a
> national speech, wrapped and packaged, standard and tasteless.
> Localness is not gon. but it is going.



> [p107] It is the nature of a man as he grows older, a small
> brindge in time, to protest against change, particularly change for
> the better.  But it is true that we have exchanged corpulence for
> starvation, and either one will kill us. [...] Perhaps my greatest wisdom
> is the knowledge that I do not know.  The sad ones are those who
> waste their energy in trying to hold it back, for they can only feel
> bitterness in loss and no joy in gain.



> [p137] Having a companion fixes you in time and that the present,
> but when the quality of aloneness settles down, past, present, and
> future all flow together.  A memory, a present event, and a forecast
> all equally present.



> [p182] When a city begins to grow and spread outward, from the
> edges, the center which was once its glory is in a sense abandoned to
> time. [...] And then one day perhaps the city returns and rips out the
> sore and builds a monument to its past.



> [p197] It is obvious that within a very short time a whole new
> method of taxation will have to be devised, else the burden on real
> estate will be so great that no one will be able to afford it;  far
> from being a source of profit, ownership will be a penalty, and this
> will be the apex of a pyramid of paradoxes.



> [p210] California Chinese, Boston Irish, Wisconsin German, yes,
> and Alabama Negroes, have more in common than they have apart.  And
> this is the more remarkable because it has happened so quickly.  It
> is a fact that Americans from all sections and of all racial
> extractions are more alike than the Welsh are like the English, the
> Lancashireman like the Cockney, or for that matter the Lowland Scot
> like the Highlander.  It is astonishing that this has happened in
> less than two hundred years and most of it in the last fifty.  The
> American identity is an exact and provable thing.
