Kim Philby is England's, and probably the world's, most notorious
double agent. His story is told in countless article and books. Ben
Macintyre tells the story from a much more personal perspective than I
believe it has been told before. The afterword by John Le Carre is
also excellent.

This is a well written historical narrative, not a spy thriller. There
are some action scenes, but most of the book is about every day
conversations and life of work colleagues who happen to be spies.

I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I learned a lot of history about the
20th century.


> [k747] The fatal conceit of most spies is to believe they are loved, in a
> relationship between equals, and not merely manipulated. Deutsch made a
> careful study of Philby's psychology, the flashes of insecurity beneath
> the debonair exterior, the unpredictable stammer, his veiled resentment
> of a domineering father.

> [k758] Completing this lurch from extreme Left (secretly) to extreme
> Right (publicly), he joined the Anglo-German Fellowship, a society formed
> in 1935 to foster closer understanding with Germany. A sump for the
> forces of appeasement and Nazi admiration, the fellowship included
> politicians, aristocrats, and business leaders, some naive or gullible,
> others rampantly fascist.

> [k767] The NKVD was convinced that someone as well connected as St John
> Philby who traveled widely and freely must be a spy. "It seems unlikely
> that his father ... would not be a close and intimate collaborator with
> the Intelligence Service." Not for the last time, Moscow elevated its
> erroneous expectations into fact.

> [k785] For a spy, Maly was conspicuous, standing six feet four inches
> tall with a "shiny grey complexion" and gold fillings in his front teeth.

> [k825] There was no equivalent welcome from his Soviet spy friends, for
> the simple reason that they were all dead or had disappeared, swept away
> by Stalin's Terror. In the wild, murderous paranoia of the Purges, anyone
> with foreign links was suspected of disloyalty, and the outposts of
> Soviet intelligence came under particular suspicion. Theodore Maly was
> among the first to be recalled to Moscow, an obvious suspect on account
> of his religious background: "I know that as a former priest I haven't
> got a chance. But I've decided to go there so that nobody can say 'That
> priest might have been a real spy after all.' " Maly was tortured in the
> cells of the Lubyanka, headquarters of the secret police, until he
> eventually confessed to being a German spy and was then shot in the head.
> The fate of Arnold Deutsch has never been fully explained.

> [k835] The task of running the Cambridge spies was taken over by one
> Grigori Grafpen, until he too was arrested and sent to the Gulag.
> Philby's controller in Paris, Ozolin-Haskins, was shot in Moscow
> in 1937. His successor, Boris Shapak, lasted two more years before he too
> was ordered home to be killed.

> [k837] As Maly put it: "If they don't kill me there, they will kill me
> here. Better to die there." One by one, Philby's handlers were declared
> enemies of the people.

> [k863] This, then, was the man who met and befriended Nicholas Elliott in
> 1940, a two-sided man who used one side to disguise the other. Elliott
> loved and admired Philby, the upper-crust, Cambridge-educated __bon viveur__,
> the charming, happily married, conservative clubman, the battle-scarred
> war correspondent now playing a vital part in the thrilling world of
> espionage. Elliott had no inkling of the other Philby, the veteran
> communist spy, and it would be many more years before he finally met him.

> [k959] As his former controller Theodore Maly had discovered to his cost,
> in the warped logic of Stalinism, refusing to do something just because
> it was impossible was a sign of disloyalty. Philby obediently set to
> work.

> [k974] The files showed there was no British spy network in Soviet
> Russia, no MI6 espionage campaign, and "no Soviet citizens whatsoever who
> worked as secret agents either in Moscow or anywhere else on Soviet
> territory." The report was received with incredulity; Moscow's paranoia
> and sense of self-importance combined to provoke a reaction of furious
> disbelief. The Soviet Union was a world power and MI6 was the most feared
> intelligence organization in the world; it therefore stood to reason that
> Britain __must__ be spying on the USSR. If Philby said otherwise, then he
> __must__ be lying.

> [k983] But when Anthony Blunt confirmed that MI6 had no secret agents in
> the USSR, he too fell under suspicion; Philby and Blunt must be in
> league. And so began a bizarre situation in which Philby told Moscow the
> truth and was disbelieved because the truth contradicted Moscow's
> expectations.

> [k1100] After just a few months in Istanbul, Elliott concluded there were
> "more people involved in various forms of skulduggery per head of
> population than any other city in the world."

> [k1200] One of the richer ironies of Philby's position is that while he
> could do no wrong in British eyes, in Moscow he continued to be viewed
> with mistrust.

> [k1416] The defections set off a chain reaction that destroyed it
> utterly, just three months before D-day.

> [k1415] The Abwehr might have been corrupt, inefficient, and partly
> disloyal, but it was, at least, a functioning worldwide intelligence
> service. The defections set off a chain reaction that destroyed it
> utterly, just three months before D-day. In the words of the historian
> Michael Howard, German intelligence was "thrown into a state of confusion
> just at the moment when its efficient functioning was vital to the
> survival of the Third Reich."

> [k1524] After a few months back in Turkey, Elliott was summoned to London
> and told by C that he had been appointed MI6 station chief in neutral
> Switzerland, a crucial intelligence battleground during the war that
> would acquire even greater importance as the cold war grew hotter.

> [k1527] "After the gloom of London and France it was an extraordinary
> contrast to be shown up to a clean bedroom with a view across the lake
> and to relax in a hot bath with a whisky and soda." After Turkey,
> Switzerland seemed disconcertingly civilized, tidy, and regulated, an
> almost artificial world.

> [k1532] Swiss efforts to discourage espionage during the war failed
> utterly: Allied, Axis, and freelance agents had converged on the country
> as a base from which to launch intelligence operations into enemy
> territory.

> [k1535] In 1943 an anti-Nazi German diplomat named Fritz Kolbe had turned
> up in Bern and offered his services to the Allies: first to the British
> embassy, which turned him away, and then to the OSS station chief Allen
> Dulles (who would go on to become director of the CIA).


> [k1563] Over the coming years, as Soviet intelligence penetrated deeper
> into Western Europe, James Angleton and Nicholas Elliott worked ever more
> closely with Philby, the coordinator of Britain's anti-Soviet operations.
> Yet the separate sides of Philby's head created a peculiar paradox: if
> all his anti-Soviet operations failed, he would soon be out of a job; but
> if they succeeded too well, he risked inflicting real damage on his
> adopted cause. He needed to recruit good people to Section IX, but not
> too good, for these might actually penetrate Soviet intelligence and
> discover that the most effective Soviet spy in Britain was their own
> boss.

> [k2769] Elliott was wholeheartedly, unwaveringly convinced of Philby's
> innocence. They had joined MI6 together, watched cricket together, dined
> and drunk together. It was simply inconceivable to Elliott that Philby
> could be a Soviet spy.

> [k2777] Within MI6 Elliott swiftly emerged as Philby's most doughty
> champion, defending him against all accusers and loudly declaring his
> innocence.

> [k3101] An amplifier, placed under the floorboards beneath Philby's
> chair, fed sound to the microphone, which was then relayed to Leconfield
> House, MI5 headquarters. Here the conversation would be recorded on
> acetate gramophone records and then handed to typists who would
> transcribe every word.

> [k3116] Philby was sent home with a friendly handshake and a not-guilty
> verdict: "You may be pleased to know that we have come to a unanimous
> decision about your innocence."

> [k3201] What followed was a dramatic tour de force, a display of cool
> public dishonesty that few politicians or lawyers could match. There was
> no trace of a stammer, no hint of nerves or embarrassment. Philby looked
> the world in the eye with a steady gaze and lied his head off. Footage of
> Philby's famous press conference is still used as a training tool by MI6,
> a master class in mendacity.

> [k3371] Operation Claret was an unmitigated, gale-force cock-up: it
> embarrassed the government, offered the Soviets an open target, deepened
> cold-war suspicion, produced no useful intelligence, turned Eden's
> diplomatic triumph to disaster, provoked renewed infighting between the
> secret services, and led to the death of a certified war hero.

> [k3456] The Beirut job finally put paid to the Philbys' marriage.
> "Haunted by Kim's life of treason" and agonized by the stress of his
> public acquittal, the discovery that her husband was leaving the country
> sent Aileen into terminal alcoholic decline.

> [k3462] Beirut was exotic, tense, and dangerous, a salmagundi of races,
> religions, and politics rendered even more febrile by the rising tide of
> Arab nationalism and cold-war conflict. It was fertile ground for
> journalism in 1956 and an even better place for espionage.

> [k3526] But there was more than politics in Philby's eager return to the
> embrace of the KGB. Philby __enjoyed__ deception.

> [k3531] Philby did not want to give up spying, and he probably could not
> have stopped if he had wanted to: he was addicted.

> [k3558] The Furse family took over all the arrangements for her funeral
> back in England, which Philby did not attend. The five Philby children
> never knew where their mother was buried.

> [k3599] In truth, Philby was going soft and drinking hard, content to do
> a little journalism, a little espionage on the side for both sides, but
> nothing too strenuous. He was coasting, it seemed, toward quiet and
> comfortable irrelevance as a second-rate journalist and a minor spy.
>
> Then
> Nicholas Elliott arrived in Beirut as the new station chief of MI6, and
> the wheel of their friendship turned again.

> [k3648] Some have claimed that Elliott's energetic deployment of Philby
> was merely a ruse to see if "greater participation in the British
> intelligence effort" would reveal contact with the Soviets. There is
> little evidence to support this theory. If Elliott had suspected Philby,
> he would have put a tail on him and easily discovered his meetings with
> Petukhov.

> [k3764] The major players in the Philby story were invariably wise after
> the event. Spies, even more than most people, invent the past to cover up
> mistakes.

> [k3767] Philby's fellow journalists (another tribe adept at
> misremembering the past) later claimed that they had always seen
> something fishy in his behavior. Even Eleanor, his wife, would later look
> back and claim to have discovered clues to his real nature.

> [k3769] The truth was simpler, as it almost always is: Philby was
> spying on everyone, and no one was spying on him, because he fooled them
> all.

> [k3824] Blake had been "turned" during his North Korean captivity. In
> detention he had read the works of Karl Marx and found what he thought
> was truth. But "it was the relentless bombing of small Korean villages by
> enormous American flying fortresses" that triggered his wholehearted
> conversion to communism.

> [k3832] In Berlin Blake contacted the KGB, under the guise of recruiting
> spies within the Soviet service, and began passing over reams of top
> secret and highly damaging information, including details of numerous
> covert operations such as the Berlin tunnel, a plot to eavesdrop on the
> Soviets from underground.

> [k3899] The news of Blake's harsh sentence left Philby stunned. He had
> spied for longer than Blake, at a far higher level, and at greater human
> cost.

> [k4144] As John le Carre once wrote: "The privately educated
> Englishman is the greatest dissembler on earth.... Nobody will charm you
> so glibly, disguise his feelings from you better, cover his tracks more
> skilfully or find it harder to confess to you that he's been a damn
> fool.... He can have a Force Twelve nervous breakdown while he stands
> next to you in the bus queue and you may be his best friend but you'll
> never be the wiser." Elliott had survived a brutal prep school, the
> chilliness of his father, the death of his first friend, by pretending
> that everything was perfectly all right. And he survived Philby's
> intimate disloyalty in exactly the same way.
> But those who knew him best saw that beneath the ever-languid
> manner, the armory of jokes, and the insouciant air, from the moment he
> finally understood and accepted Philby's treachery Elliott's world
> changed utterly: inside he was crushed, humiliated, enraged, and
> saddened.

> [k4176] In Beirut Eleanor Philby watched in despair as her once-charming
> husband fell apart in a miasma of drink and depression.

> [k4322] He would later claim he had been merely playing for time, toying
> with Elliott, controlling the situation with "just a little stalling,
> just a little drinking" while he made his plans. His behavior suggests
> otherwise. Philby was in turmoil, trapped, tempted by Elliott's offer,
> and acutely conscious that his future depended on how he played the game.

> [k4399] Elliott later claimed that the idea Philby might defect to the
> USSR had never occurred to him or anyone else. "It just didn't dawn on
> us." This defies belief. Burgess and Maclean had both defected; Blake
> would escape from Wormwood Scrubs Prison in 1966 and make his way to
> Moscow.

> [k4519] To Elliott fell the delicate and exceedingly unpleasant task of
> breaking the news to James Angleton. The FBI knew about the confrontation
> in Beirut and Philby's confession, but the CIA had been kept entirely in
> the dark.

> [k4558] Many in the intelligence world believed that by leaving the door
> open to Moscow and then walking away, Elliott had deliberately forced
> Philby into exile. And they may have been right.
>
> Divining Elliott's precise motives is impossible, because for
> the next thirty years he carefully obscured and muddied them.

> [k4696] James Jesus Angleton's personality was transformed by the
> realization that he had never really known Kim Philby.

> [k4700] He became convinced that a vast, overarching conspiracy must be
> taking place under his nose, orchestrated by Philby from Moscow.

> [k4704] "Never again would he permit himself to be so badly
> duped. He would trust no one."
>
> Convinced that the CIA was riddled with Soviet spies, Angleton
> set about rooting them out, detecting layer after layer of deception
> surrounding him.

> [k4708] The damage he inflicted on the CIA reached such levels that some
> even accused him of being a Soviet mole himself, destroying the
> organization from within by creating a climate of debilitating suspicion.
> Uncompromising and obsessive, more than a decade after Philby's vanishing
> act Angleton was still ascribing every fresh sign of treachery to the man
> he had once idolized. "This is all Kim's work," he would mutter.

> [k4717] James Angleton was forced out of the CIA in 1974, when the extent
> of his illegal mole hunting was revealed.
>
> He continued to insist that he had suspected Kim Philby from
> the start; but his weeding from CIA files of every reference to his
> relationship with Philby was proof enough of the falsity of that claim.

> [k4727] Nicholas Elliott's career was hobbled by his association with
> Philby. Some in MI6 believed he had allowed Philby to flee Beirut out of
> personal loyalty. Some still do.

> [k4751] Nicholas Elliott had become--no one was quite sure how--an
> unofficial adviser on intelligence matters to Margaret Thatcher. What was
> discussed during these meetings has never been fully revealed, and
> Elliott was far too discreet to say, but his political antennae were
> impeccable: after the breakup of the Soviet Union, he correctly predicted
> the emergence of an authoritarian government in Russia, and he foresaw
> the growth of Islamic fundamentalism, the rise of Iranian aggression, and
> the growing economic and political clout of China.
