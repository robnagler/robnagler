By Peter L. Bernstein, Scribner, September 1, 1984, 978-0684181707

Peter Bernstein takes us on a fascinating tour of Bell Labs, the
research institution.  He covers the numerous discoveries, the
management philosophy, and above all, the people.  The people made
Bell Labs the premier research institution in its heydays.

> [p108] [Addison White:] Incidentally, as a comparison, I think
> that our country [p109] has been conducting its affairs in an absurd
> way on cancer research. much of which is being done without a guiding
> idea. We are trying to throw hundreds of millions of dollars at the
> problem without enough ideas. which is nonsense. It would have been
> the same sort of thing if we had tried to move more rapidly in the
> case of the transistor."



> [p113] [Addison White:] When it came to the transistor I had no real
> ideas of my own. and that. I think. is a good thing for a technical
> manager. because it means that he does not compete professionally with
> the men who are reponing to him. 1 think Bill Shockley's fundamental
> problem as a manager was that -he was competing. Perhaps because of my
> personal history. I have always been utterly skeptical that any school
> of business administration can teach people how to manage. My Own
> concern has always been. how does one motivate these extremely able
> people? Pan of the answer is, of course. to hope that one way or
> another you can arrange it so that they will be doing work that is
> just a little beyond their capacity. That's the way people grow. I
> think that when it came to the responsibility I had for the materials
> side of the transistor. it worked. A good deal of this early
> transistor work was really development as opposed to physics
> research. When it comes to research, about all one can do is to
> recruit very able people in fields relevant to the Laboratories'
> mission and turn them loose, as is done in a university.   



> [p140] [Phil Anderson:] "It is hard to realize that in most other
> fields of science this close collaboration is not accepted. The
> machines are too big. the specialties too sharply defined. and the
> whole sociology is hostile to inviting a theorist to think about raw
> data and experimental arrangements or an experimentalist to propose a
> theoretical model himself. The idea is. 'A gentleman doesn't interpret
> another gentleman's data.' I feel strongly that nature is hard enough
> to understand without inserting artificial barriers. So many theorists
> refuse to look at experimental facts. on the grounds of some kind of
> false idea of 'fairness' or of playing science like a game with set
> rules. Or they insist on using false and sometimes meaningless
> standards of mathematical rigor to test a theory intended to explain
> data amassed on fallible instruments or from samples of unknown
> purity. There is a rigor of physical thinking that is necessary but
> entirely different from these mathematical games.  



> "Collaborations are, at least now. easy here at Bell. because the
> presumption and the atmosphere are one of openness. That is encouraged
> by the fact that our managers manage. not in the sense of telling
> people what to do but of knowing what people are doing. After the war
> Peter Debye. who was a consultant here. ran what were known as the
> Debye sessions. In those. everyone talked about their work in progress
> in front of Debye and in front of the directors. There was no way not
> to be open about one's working progress.



> [p146] [Phil Anderson:] There are a few very rare examples where, if
> you are very lucky, you can start with the material and really
> calculate everything from first principles. I have done that kind of
> work. My thesis was sort of like that. But normally you can't do
> that. A real material contains all kinds of junk. There are too many
> electrons, and so on, so one has to abstract something relevant from
> the material. The first time I did that was with the ferroelectrics. I
> did not realize then that I could do it; I just did it. I am told that
> I have a mind that thinks quantum mechanically. I have always felt
> that quantum mechanics is a lot easier than classical mechanics. That
> feeling goes right back to my orals at Harvard-which I almost didn't
> pass-where they asked me to explain how the top works in classical
> mechanics, which I couldn't do. I can do at least the simple versions
> of the top in my head quantum mechanically.



> [p146] [Phil Anderson:] Chemists, for example; are notorious
> empiricists, and they are capable of living indefinitely with
> anomalies that stare them [p147] right in the face. People are
> perfectly capable of ignoring them, or they might puzzle about them
> for a few years, and if nobody solves them everyone forgets about
> them. In this sense, they just disappear and get encapsulated. I have
> seen that encapsulation of anomalies occur again and again in
> science. They stay there until someone notices them."
