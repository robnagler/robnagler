My father was an artist and a soldier so this book was personal. When
I read that Urbain's (main character's) father mixed paint with
saliva, I thought of my dad. Turpentine is a carcinogen. My dad died
of cancer. Urbain's father (an artist) died of consumption, but he
also had lead poisoning. Not particularly germane to the novel, but
still, the book brought back many memories, both good and bad.

Urbain was the soldier, not his father. He became an artist, but that
was not his profession. Urbain was man who did what asked of
him. Again, that was my father, but while he went to war, he was more
of a soldier at home. Urbain was a soldier in war and at home.

Stefan Hertmans writes in a way. I read in the NY Times book review
that "Whether that truth is documentary or dramatic (and carefully
constructed) is a question this reader occasionally wrestled with, but
mostly set aside." I felt exactly this way. It's an intriguing story
full of emotion.

Urbain's first financee dies of the Flu in 1919. I write this during
the COVID-19 pandemic, 100 years later. Fortunately, I don't know
anybody who has died from COVID-19. It's scary, though, to think that
100,000 people have died in the last couple of months. Not tens of
millions, like in 1919. I can't imagine how it was back then, but I
have a sense of it, along with the death and destruction of World War
I, thanks to War and Turpentine.

This was my father: he gave away all his paintings. I don't think he
sold one. He worked as a commercial artist, for which he got paid, but
he remained lower middle class is whole life. He wasn't poor, of
course, but he was a great painter who could have made much more money
than he did.
