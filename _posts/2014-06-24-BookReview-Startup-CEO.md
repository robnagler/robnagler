If a book has one actionable idea, it's a great success.
[Matt Blumberg](https://twitter.com/mattblumberg) has provided a gold mine of ideas, at least to me.  Thanks!

Matt rekindled the idea of blogging for me.  I used to think of
blogging as something to do when you aren't busing creating "real
stuff".  Matt promotes the idea of maintaining a public persona for
recruiting purposes.  He is also into transparency, and talks candidly
on
[his blog](http://onlyonce.com) about his work at Return Path.  That's likely to be my goal in
renewing my blogging efforts.

Transparency is a core value for Matt.  He takes
it a step further than most CEOs.
[Here's a recent example](http://www.onlyonceblog.com/2014/04/understanding-the-drivers-of-success) on his blog.
I've always believed in transparency.  What I appreciate about Matt's
approach is that he describes the mechanisms to achieve it:
[360-degree reviews](http://www.onlyonceblog.com/2005/06/what_a_view),
[postmortems](http://www.onlyonceblog.com/2011/03/the-art-of-the-post-mortem),
[admit mistakes](http://www.onlyonceblog.com/2004/09/political_versu-2), the "board book", and, of course, blogging.

Matt's book is a collaborative effort.  He includes "cameos" from many other
people at Return Path and a few outsiders, too.  The contributions are excellent,
and demonstrate Matt's commitment to teamwork.

This is a book about Return Path and some content is taken from Matt's blog.
Some reviewers have complained about this.  To me, it makes sense,
because the context is necessary to show how the ideas work.  Matt's blog
allows him to user-test his descriptions of those ideas.  Taken together,
it's a cohesive and coherent story of Matt's career and life at Return Path over
the last 15 years, warts and all.

Matt is a "systems guy".  I relate to that.  As you may have guessed already,
his systems encompass everything in his life, including his "home operating system".  Really?  Yup.  He talks about "anchors" like Friday night dinner at home and
coaching a kid's sports team.  These days it's necessary, especially if you are
running a startup, like Return Path.  While my life isn't nearly as complicated,
I appreciate Matt's approach to squeezing "every minute out of each day".  It's
important when you have to balance everything.

One of the techniques I hope to implement is "just a second".  Matt insists "on
finishing whatever quick task or thought I'm working on before engaging" in
an interruption.  It's tough to do this, especially given that I'm such a pleaser.
However, Matt has reminded me how important this is.  You have to be
interruptible, and you can control your task switching time so you are most
efficient.

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  As a Return Path investor,
[Startup CEO](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DL0Q) increased my confidence in Matt as captain who knows keeps a
tight ship with grace and style.
