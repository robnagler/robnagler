Jakob Nielsen and Hoa Loranger make their money helping large
companies create better UIs.  I commend them.  This book is a rehash
of Nielsen's earlier work on usability.  He admits this clearly in
that he presents it as a retrospective.  However, there's nothing
new, really.   They are great suggestions, but we need more, e.g., it
would be great if he gave us advice how UI consultants can get
people who work in large companies to heed their advice.  We know what
it takes to make a good UI, and there are plenty of examples on the
Web, yet big and small companies seem to create awful UIs as a matter
of policy.  Don't Make Me Think by Steve Krug at least takes a stab at
this.  It's sad that Nielsen doesn't share his vast experience in this
area.

 I find this a very strong statement for which the authors do not
present data:

As Web sites improve, search engines will confiscate almost all the
increased profits they gain from increased usability. In other words,
search engines need do nothing but watch their incomes grow as
mainstream Web sites do all the hard work of improving the Web. Is
this fair? No. But the reality is that search engines drive much of
the new traffic that a site can hope to attract.
