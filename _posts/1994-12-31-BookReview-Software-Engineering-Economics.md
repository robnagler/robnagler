 The classic text on waterfall development.  You need to read
it to understand the "norm".  Barry Boehm clearly has a long
experience with large teams.


> [p39] If the software requirements error is detected and corrected
> during the plans and requirements phase, its correction is a relatively
> simple matter of updating the requirements specification.  If the same
> error is not [p40] corrected until the maintenance phase, the correction
> involves a much larger inventory of specifications, code, user and
> maintenance manuals, and training material.



> [p310] When we first begin to evaluate alternative concepts for a new
> software application, the relative range of our software cost estimates
> is roughly a factor of four on either the high or low side.<footnote>
> These ranges have been determined subjectively, and are intended to
> represent 80% confidence limits, that is, "within a factor of four on
> either side, 80% of the time."</footnote>



> [p311] By the time we complete and validate a product design
> specification, we will have resolve such issues as the internal data
> structure of the software product and specific techniques for handling
> the buffers between the terminal microprocessor and the central
> processors on one side, and between the microprocessor and the display
> driver on the other.  At this point, are software estimate should be
