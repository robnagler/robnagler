 This pop-psych book is pretty good if you haven't read much
pop-psych.  It provides a cognitive approach (like others) about
respecting others' styles to get the most out your relationships.


> [p66] Style flex involves tailoring your behavior so that your work
> fits better with the other person's style.  Flexing your behaviors is
> like a professional baseball player electing to swing differently at a
> fastball, a slider, and a curve.



> [p68] People sometimes get the idea that style flex involves giving
> in to the other person's opinions or agreeing with their ideas.
> Nothing could be further from the truth.  Style flex is a way of
> adapting to another person's process; it is not about conforming to his
> or her point of view.  It is about relating constructively while
> appropriately disclosing your perspective on things as well as
> listening emphatically to others.  The better the interpersonal
> process, the more likely that people accurately hear each other and
> creatively resolve conflicting opinions.



> [p72] When a relationship isn't going well, don't do more of the same;
> try something different.
