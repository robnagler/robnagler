By Louis J. Cozolino, W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 2002, 0-393-70367-3
 Cozolino describes the relationship between psychotherapy and the
brain.  He demonstrates that nature vs. nuture is a red-herring,
because nuture modifies nature and nature modifies nuture.  The brain
is continually developing and changing.  He explains the chemistry and
psychology behind modern illnesses such as PTSD and depression.
