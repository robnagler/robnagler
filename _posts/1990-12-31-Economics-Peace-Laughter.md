Various essays.


> [p7] Economic goals are paramount. [...] Economics is progressive as
> regards the first type of change--conceptual advances or innovations in
> interpretive apparatus are promptly examined, enthusiastically discussed
> and, where useful, willingly adopted.



> [p8] Unions and large corporations make the dynamics of organization as
> important as the authority of the market in telling what will happen.
> This, in turn, diminishes the authority of economic judgement.



> [p9] Thus does a scientific or pseudo-scientific posture direct
> economics away from accommodation to underlying social and institutional
> change.



> [p11] The Roosevelt economists were largely without economic prestige.



> [p12] Though production and employment were the central problems of the
> Great Depression, they have not by any available standard of measurement
> been so serious since. [...] The primary prescription [put forth by
> economists] must hencefroth be for the improvement of what may broadly be
> called the quality of life.  This should now be the foremost goal.



> [p13] And most must agree that the individual should be the end in
> himself and not the instrument to of the business firm or public
> bureaucracy which was created to serve him.



> [p14] It should also be observed that if appropriate attention is not
> accorded to public needs, the private sectory itself will suffer in
> technical performance. [...] Thus it comes about that the remedy for
> unemployment and individual privation depends to a very considerable
> degree on the balance between public and private services--or, more
> generally, on measures to improve the quality of life.



> [p15] Defense expenditures are a large share of all public outlays and
> also are protected by special attitudes and a powerful constituency.



> [p16] [T]he policy invites a coalition between those who seek tax
> reduction for purposes of Keynesian policy and those who simply want lower
> taxes and less government. [...] The quality of life will also suffer if the
> individual is not an end in himself but an instrument of some purpose that
> is not his own. [...] 'There is also a rising realization that there is
> something wrong about reducing taxes unless something also is done about
> curbing expenditures to avoid the need for big deficits in budgets. ...
> This failure to place equal emphasis on expenditure reduction can mean an
> danger of continuing big deficits.' 'Important Trends in Our Economy,'
> United States Steel Corporation, Annual Report, 1963, p. 38.



> [p17] The corporation requires its own typo of man; he must be willing
> to subordinate his own goals to those of the organization.  And it is
> necessary if the organization is to succeed.  It is what makes possible
> group performance of tasks.  And by combining experience, knowledge,
> technical skills, and art, such group performance greatly improves on what
> an individual can accomplish, popular myth to the contrary. [...] The
> behavior and beliefs of a society are, in fact, subject to extensive
> management to accord with economic need and convenience.  Not even
> scientific truth, much as our culture presumes to canonize it, is exepmt.
> The tobacco industry has not yet ceased to reveal its discontent with
> scientists who, on the basis of rather impressive evidence, aver that
> cigarettes are a cause not only of lung cancer but a disconcerting
> assortment of other fatal or disabling maladies.  The economic well-being
> of the industry requires the active and energetic recruitment of new
> customers.  This need is paramount.  So there is no alternative to
> impeaching the scientist and their evidence.



> [p18] The Eisenhower-Mills contention was, in essence, that defence
> budgets and procurements were being influenced not by national need but by
> what served the economic interests of suppliers.



> [p19] We live surrounded by a systematic appeal to a dream world which
> all mature, scientific reality would reject.  We, quite literally,
> advertise our commitment to immaturity, mendacity and profound
> gullibilty.  It is the hallmark of the culture.  And it is justified as
> being economically indispensable.



> [p22] If an economist writes a book or even an article in clear
> English, he need say nothing.  He will be praised for avoiding jargon--and
> also for risking the rebuke of his professional colleagues in doing so. [...]
> The language of economics is commonly indicted on three different
> counts... 1. That the ideas and terminolgy of economics are complex and
> artifical and exceedingly confusing to the layman.  2.  That economists
> are bad writers.... 3. That arcane concepts and obscure language are the
> symptoms of a deeper disorder.



> [p23] But it would be hard to prove that the working terminology of the
> subject [economics] is more pretentious or otherwise oppressive than that
> of jurisprudence, gynaecology or advanced poultry husbandry.



> [p24] This is not because it is the task of the economist to entertain
> or amues.  Nothing could be more abhorrent to the Calvinist gloom which
> characterizes all scientific attitudes .  But humour is an index of a
> man's ability to detach himself from his subject and such detachment is of
> considerable scentific utility.



> [p25] 'People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for
> merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against
> the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.' Adam Smith, The
> Wealth of Nations, Methuen, 1950, p. 130. [...] To this day, in the United
> States at least, anyone observing an exchange of words between two
> competitors assumes it is costing the public some money.



> [p26] After [Thorstein Veblen] made the phrase 'conspicuous
> consumption' a part of the language, the real estate market in Newport was
> never again the same. [...] 'Conspicuous leisure' made it difficult even for
> the daughters of the rich to relax.  Their entertainment had thereafter to
> be legitimatized by charitable, artistic oreven entellectual purpose or,
> at a minimum, sexual relief.



> [p27] so it would be difficlut, on the general evidence, to find fault
> with the litorary qualifications of the English-writing economists.



> [p28] The influence of [Keynes' book 'The General Theory'], combined
> with its unintelligibility, does bring up another question.  It is whether
> clear and unambiguous statement is the best medium for persuasion in
> economics.  Here, I think, one may have doubts.



> [p29] The archiac constructions and terminology put some special strain
> on the reader.  Accordingly, by the time he has worked his way through,
> say, Leviticus, he has vested interest in what he has read...  Too much
> has gone into understanding it. [...] Difficultly, contradiction and ambiguity
> have rendered precisely similar service in economics.



> [p30] Yet ambiguity is a tactic which not everyone should try.
> Economists will seize upon the ill-expressed ideas of a very great man and
> argue over what he had in mind.  Others had better not run the risk.



> [p31] Professional economists, like members of city gangs, ... holders
> of diplomatic passports and, one is told, followers of the intellectually
> more demanding criminal pursuits, have the natural desigre of all such
> groups to delineate and safeguard the boundary between those who belong
> and those who do not.



> [p34] Much of [economic writing], and more especially that exchanged in
> the upper levels of the pyramid, is not meant to be [relevant to the real
> world]. So it may be ignored.



> [p35] Footnote 11 The layman may take comfort from the fact that the
> most esoteric of this materialis not read by other economists or even by
> the editors who publish it.  In the economics profession the editorship of
> a learned journal not specialized in econometrics or mathematical
> statistics is a position of only moderate prestige.  It is accepted,
> moreover, that the editor must have a certain measure of practical
> judgement.  This means that he is usually unable to read the moost
> prestiguous contributions which, nono the less, he must publish.  So it is
> the proctice of the editor to associatewith himself a mathematical curate
> who passes on this part of the work and whose word he takes.  A
> certain embarrassed silence covers the arrangement.



> [p36] [T]he Keynesian revolution was one of the greate modern
> accomplishments in social design.



> [p38] Until [The General Theory] appeared, economists, in the classical
> (or non-socialist) tradition, had asusmed that the economy, if left to
> itself, would find its equilibrium at full employment.



> [p39] Keynes writing Roosevelt 'I lay overwhelming emphasis on the
> increase of national purchasing power resulting from government
> expenditure which is financed by loans.'



> [p40] Not often have important new ideas on economics entered a
> government by way of its central bank.  Nor should anyone be disturbed.
> There is not the slightest indication that it will every happen again. [...]
> Simon Kiznets and a group of young economists and statisticians at the
> University of Pennsylvania, the National Bureau of Economic Research and
> the United States Department of Commerce ... developed from earlier
> beginnings the now familiar concepts of national income and gross national
> product and their components, and made estimates of their amount. [...] As a
> result, those who were translating Keynes's ideas into action could now
> know not only what needed to be done but how much.



> [p41] Paul Samuelson ... has compared the excitement of the young
> economists on the arrival of Keynes's book to that of Keats on first
> looking into Chapman's Homer. [...] [O]bscurity [of the book] stimulated
> abstract debate. [...] Alvin H. Hansen [who had catalysed the discussion] had
> an established reputation, and he did change his mind.



> [p42] Keynesian policies became central to what was called postwar
> planning and designs for preventing the re-emergence of massive
> unemployment.



> [p44] The Council of Economic Advisers became, in turn, a platform for
> expounding the Keynesian view of the economy and it was brought promptly
> into use. [...] Those who nuture thoughts of conspiracy and clandestine
> plots will be saddened to know that this was a revolution without
> organization.



> [p45] Still, where resisting social change is involved, there are men
> who can surmount any handicap. [...] In the fifties a group of graduates of
> mature years banded together in an organization called the Veritas
> Foundation and financed a volume called Keynes at Harvard.... But then it
> damaged this highly plausible proposition by identifying Keynesianism with
> socialism, Fabian socialism, Marxism, communism, fascism and also literary
> incest, meaning that one Keynesian always reviewed the works of another
> Keynesian.



> [p48] Now, as noted, Keynesian policies are the new orthodoxy.
> Economists are everywhere to be seen enjoying theeir new and pleasantly
> uncontreversial role. [...] And there is a dangerously high dependence on
> military spending.



> [p50] A recurring and not unsubstantiated charge against economics over
> the last century has been its employment not as a science but as a
> supporting faith.



> [p51] Except where monopoly or intent to monopolize could be should,
> [economic] theory denied the need for any social response to economic
> power.  It was playing an active--an actively conservative--role in the
> political process.



> [p52] [Say's Law of Markets] defended a miminmal role for the state. [...]
> Journalists and politicians and the public at large had sensed what the
> theory denied or ignored, namely that where the participants in an
> industry were large and few, they wielded great power not explained by the
> occasional case of single-firm monopoly.



> [p53] I wish to argue that present professional belief...as profoundly
> accepted as was once the competitive model or Say's Law, is now similarly
> excluding urgent as well as politically disturbing questions from
> professional economic vision. [...] The accepted economic models, in the
> past, have not necessarily been the ones that illuminated reality.  They
> have frequently served to divert attenton from questions of great social
> urgency which, in the established view, had alarming implications for
> political action.  In doing this, they and the subject of economics have
> served a political function, Economics has been not a science but a
> conservatively useful system of belief defending that belief as a
> science.  And knowing, and indeed agreeing, that this has occurred before,
> our minds must be open (or less incautiously closed) to the possibility
> that it may happen again. [...] The assumption that economics must now
> abandon...what may also be called citizen sovereignty.  If this is not
> done the discipline will serve, indeed is now serving, not as an
> elucidation of social phenomena but as a design for suppresing
> inconvenient social conclusions and action.



> [p54] There are three plausible views of the individual in economic
> society of which two are broadly consistent with the neo-classical model.
> In the first view, the individual in economic life is regarded as a
> neutral or passive participant in a process for transmitting change.



> [p55] The socond view of the individual in economic society is a still
> of a process.  Though in principle this process is still a neutral
> trasmitter of change, including change that originates with the producer,
> the ultimate guidance is assumed to come from the individual.



> [p56] The third possible view sees the process as one in which the
> ultimate accoodation in significant measure is to the producer.  The
> individual's wants, though superficially they may seem to originate with
> him, are ultimately at the behest of the mechanism that supplies them.



> [p57] And it also selects and designs products with a view to what can
> be so priced and made subject to such persuasion. [...] On occasion the state
> will supply related services that support the requisite behaviour of the
> indivdual -- its provision of highways as an aspect of the management of
> consumer behaviour by the automobile industry is an obvious example.



> [p58] For important classes of products and services -- weapons
> systems, space probes and travel, a supersonic transport -- decisions are
> not taken by the individual citizen and voter and transmitted to the
> state.  They are taken by the producers of public services, that is, by
> the armed services and the weapons firms.  It is their goals that,
> primarily, are served.  The Congress and the public are then persuaded or
> commanded to acceptance of these decisions. [...] The extent of the
> accomodation of the individual to producer need varies with the power of
> the producing organization.



> [p60] In the established view economic life remains a process by which
> the individual imposes his will on the producer[.]



> [p60] Here [in the world of the textbook] the commitment to consumer (and
> citizen) sovereignty remains virtually absolute.



> [p61] Footnoote 21 One notes also that advertizing has continued to be
> a somewhat indigestible lump in conventional micro-economic theory.



> [p62] Nor will many resists thet idea that these industries can bring
> the state to the support of their attempts to create and manage consumer
> wants[.] [...] For if goods are firmly established as the cause of happiness,
> the public will be both attentive and responsive to claims on their
> behalf.



> [p63] In the accepted economomics...[t]he individual is ultimately and
> fundamentally in commmand; he cannot be at war with an economy he controls
> for he cannot be at war with himself. [...] When producer sovereignty is
> assumed...[t]he plausible consequence of economic development... is not
> harmony between the individual and economic institutions but conflict.



> [p64] [I]t is a commonplace explanation of tension and discontent that
> the individual feels himself in he grip of larg, impersonal forces whose
> purposes he sencses to be hostile and in relation to which he feels
> helpless.



> [p65] The notion of consumer and citizen sovereignty is otherwise
> diverting attention from fundamental problems of the economic and
> political system in a fashion that serves to strengthen the very producer
> sovereignty that the discipline denies. [...] 1. If the mix of goods being
> produced at any given time seems unsatisfactory -- if there are too many
> automabiles, too little mass transport, much television, few houses --
> consumer sovereignty holds that this reflects the dominant conusmer will.



> [p66] 2. The concept of consumer sovereignty acts with marked force to
> inhibit questions concerning the cultural achievements of the system. [...]
> 3. The concept of consumer and citizen sovereignty alows no arganic
> likelihood of a a bias in the economy for private as opposed to those
> public goods that do not server producer sovereignty.



> [p67] 4. Conusmer and citizen sovereignty sanctions the current calims
> on resources of the military and associated industrial power. [...] 5.
> Consumer sovereignty makes pollution and other environmental disharmony a
> diseconomy external to the industry.



> [p68] 6. Consumer sovereignty allows no question as to a socially
> desirable upper limit to the consumption either in general or of
> particular products.



> [p69] 7. Cosunmer sovereignty goes some way to sanctioning income
> inequality. [...] 8. Finally, if consumer sovereignty is assumed, there will
> be a strong presumption that actions directly or indirectly affecting the
> consumer's market behaviour will have a strong and reliable market
> response.



> [p70] The state as here envisiaged comes close to being the executive
> commitee of the large porducing organization -- of the technostructure.
> It stabilizes aggregate demand, underwrites or socializes expensive or
> risky technology, replects the will of large organization in the mix of
> military and non-military public goods, provides such needed public
> artifacts as highways for the managemen of specific consumer demand,
> supplies qualified manpower, otherwise stabilizes those parameters or
> does that planning which the large producing organization cannot do for
> itself. [...] if the weapons industry is sovereign in the Congress, can it be

> [p85] The railroads were similarly marked out by the new American
> socialism for its first offensive. [...] The socialist thrust against the
> Penn Central was led by the executives of the railroad[.]



> [p87] The Lockheed Corporation is also very big -- it is the largest
> defence firm and was forty-first mang all industrial corporations in 1969.
> As a candidatefor socialism, it has certain peculiarities; there are some

> plant belongs to the Federal Government; it gets most of its working
> capital from the goverment; until recently, nearly all of its business
> came from the government; its famous cost overruns are fully socialized.



> [p88] President Nixon's third socialist front is the socialized SST.



> [p90] The Wall Street vehicle of the new socialism is the Securities
> Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a fund created by the Stock
> Exchange which is to be guaranteed by the goverment to the extent of a

> [p106] Footnote 3 One of the greatest investment trust promotions of
> the twenties was by Goldman, Sachs and Company, isnce become more austere,
> under the auspices of Waddil Catchings, the most notable of the
> contemporary financial geniuses until the Crash.  In 1929 Goldman, Sachs
> sold nearly 500 million dolars worth of securities in its investment
> trusts.  In 1932, the following colloquy took place before a Senate
> Committee in Washington:



> SENATOR COUZENS: Did Goldman, Sachs and Company organize the Goldman,
> Sachs Trading Corporation [one of the investment trusts]?



> MR SACHS: Yes, Sir



> SENATOR COUZENS: And it sold its stock to the public?



> MR SACHS: A portion of it.  The firms invested originally in 10 per cent
> of the entire issue for the sumo of $10,000,000.



> SENATOR COUZENS: And the other 90 per cent was sold to the public?



> MR SACHS: Yes, sir.



> SENATOR COUZENS: At what price?



> MR SACHS: At 104.  That is the old stock... the stock was split two for
> one.



> SENATOR COUZENS: And what is the price of the stock now?



> MR SACHS: Approximatelt 1 3/4.



> [p107] It was learned, in the very late twenties, although no one had
> much thought of it before, that when stocks go down, leverage goes
> brutally into reverse.



> [p108] The late twenties was a period of Napoleonic mergers. [...] The
> basic technique was to issue bonds or preferred stocks with which to buy
> the common stocks of the companies being merged.



> [p110] The Chase National Bank was shortly to suffer painfully for the
> conflicting private operations of its president, the redoubtable Albert H.
> Wiggin.  In 1929 he borrowed from the bank to sell the stock of the bank
> short and subsequently claimed that such operations heightened a man's
> interest in his business.



> [p121] JAmes J. Walker, then the remarkably indolent Mayor of New York,
> offered the only constructive proposal of the day.  Addressing an audience
> of motion picture exhibitors, he asked them to 'show pictures that will
> reinstate courage and hope in the hearts of the people.'



> [p125] Writing in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith concluded
> that the building and maintenance of 'public instutitions' and 'public
> works' as a function of the state was surpassed in importance only by
> provision for common defence and the administration of justice. [...] Since
> then the position of the public builder has declined.  I would like to
> argue that this is unfortunate for, in cosequence, we fail to encourage
> good trends in public building and favour bad ones. [...] But public
> structures had always been something more. A castle had always been more
> than a defence facility, to use the modern term.  A palace had always been
> more than a shelter.  By their magnificence, these structures proclaimed
> the power, wealth, ability to confiscate wealth and, on frequent
> occasions, the good taste of the occupant.



> [p126] And the citizenry which looked on the buildings, often from a
> considerable distance, could at least reflect that it was no mean and
> miserly authority by which they were exploited. [...] All this makes clear
> that where the public building is involved, usefulness is an elusive
> concept.  The plain functional structure may not be the most useful.



> [p127] No investment of the sensible Munich burghers who held Ludwig
> [II of Bavaria] to be off his rocker ever paid off so well for so long.



> [p128] The extravagance of one period is, on occasion, the eyesore of
> the next. [...] In the years of the Great Depression, public buildings ceased
> for a time to be things that were needed and enjoyed and became, instead,
> a solution to the unemployment problem.



> [p129] The second and much more important change occurred in the years
> following the Second World War. [...] Public consumption required thet
> coercive collection of taxes and was thus morally inferior.  The state, in
> this view, had personality that was separate and distinct from the people
> it comprised.



> [p130] The era of false austerity will, I am sure, one day come to a
> close. [...] Public consumption is not inferior.



> [p132] Wherever travel is for enjoyment or even where enjoyment is an
> important by-product of travel, protection of beauty must take precedence

> getting to their destination.



> [p135] The decade of the sixties, in the absence of a massively
> successful revisionist exercise, will be counted a very dismal period in
> American foreign policy.  Indeed, next only to the cities, forign policy
> will be considered the prime disaster area of the American polity and it
> will be accorded much of the blame for the misuse of energies and
> resources that caused the trouble in urban ghettos and the alienation and
> eruption in the universities.



> [p136] In the Cuban missile crisis President Kennedy had to balance the
> danger of blowing up the planet against the risk of political attack at
> home for appeasing the Communists.  This was not an irresponsible choice;
> to ignore the domestic opposition was to risk losing initiative or office
> to men who wanted an even more dangerous policy. [...] We were in lick but
> success in a lottery is no argument for lotteries.



> [p137] The Communist world is as relentlessly plural as the
> non-Communist world;  China and the Soviet Union are much farther from
> coordinated action than France and the United States.  On the record, too,
> the Communist powers are cautious--rather more cautios perhaps than the
> government of the United States--about risking disaster in pursuit of an
> idea. [...] [T]here has been a considerable accretion of knowledge both about

> the contest under the control of the armed services and the affiliated
> weapons industries.



> [p139] But first let me list what we have learned from dealing with the
> Third World in the last decade. [...] 1. We have learned, first of all, the
> limits on our power in this part of the world.



> [p140] Thus it has come about that the superpower which seeks to
> intervene in the Third World remains the victim of the organizational,
> administrative and technical vacuum which, after all, is what tends most
> to distinguish this World. [...] 2....Communism and copitalism are concepts
> of practical significance only at an advanced stage in industrial
> development.



> [p141] By the time India, sub-Sahara Africa and mos of Central or South
> America areindustrialized to anything approaching present Western European
> levels, even greater changes will have accurred in the United States and
> the Soviet Union.



> [p142] American foreign policy in the fifties and sixties was made by
> men to whon a difference between capitalism and Communism was the only
> social truth to which they had access. [...] 3...[A]lthough the inner life
> and development of the Third World is beyond the reach of the power of a
> superpower, and equally beyond its visible self-concern, the effort to
> influence that development brings into being a very large civilian and
> military bureaucracy.



> [p143] [A]n overseas bureaucracy, once in existence, develops a life
> and purpose of its own.



> [p145] Since Korea we have been learing and relearning the lesson that
> strategic air power is ineefective against primitive agriculture or men
> moving at night along jungle roads.



> [p147] In Galbraith's opinion about what foreign policy should be.  Not
> distinguishing between good and bad governments, we recognize all.  We also
> trade with all.



> [p149] Not wickedness but the dynamics of big organization is involved.
> It is a far greater factor in our foreign policy than we have even begun
> to realize.



> [p150] Immediately following the Second Wordl War, I was nominally in
> charge of economic policy in Germany and Japan.  (I say 'nominally'for our
> two proconsuls in the field, General Lucius Clay in Germany and General
> dourglas MacArthur in Japan, prevented anyone in Washington from having a
> damaging sense of personal power.  We often discussed what we would do if
> MacArthur completely severed relations. One idea was to cut him off from

> [p153] American missions abroad are believed also to be sadly
> overstaffed and with people who are neither very responsible nor very
> smart.



> [p156] When no one in the [State] Department knows what to do about a

> [p164] One of the generally amiable idiosyncrasies of man is his
> ability to expend a great deal of effort without much inquiry as to why.



> [p165] If the distribution of resources between necessaries and
> luxuries -- between products for the masses and the more esoteric delights
> of the few -- seems wrong, the thing to change is the distribution of
> income.  An increase of taxes on the incomes of the well-to-do or the
> products they consume is the appropriate remedy. [...] Development is and
> should be the faithful imitation of the developed.



> [p167] And much symbolic modernization [in the poor countries] is a
> political stratagem for fooling people into believing sometihng is being
> done.



> [p168] Thus not only does undifferentiated growth tend to support
> higher-income consumption, it may do so partly as the result of saving
> from lower-income consumption.



> [p169] Thus, althought there may be wide agreement on a policy of
> selective economic growth, there can be very little agreement on what
> should be selected.



> [p170] The goal I am here describing -- I have called it the Popular
> Consumption Criterion -- will be seen to resolve the political problems
> which arise in connection with other criteria.  The attention of those who
> tax, plan or otherwise infuence economic resources is kept concentrated on
> the needs of the typical consumer.



> [p171] By an odd arrangement of things, poor countries, such as India
> in the past, have produced luxuries for the affluent lands.



> [p172] [P]overty has more to do with determing social and political

> well-to-do.



> [p173] The soundest of political rules is always to mistrust the

> Their role is exclusively related to domestic politics and income.
