By A. A. Milne, Dutton's Childrens Books, 1994
 There is so much wisdom in simple words.  I really enjoy
reading this book.


> [p44] [pooh] "Well, either a tail _is_ or isn't there.  You can't make a
> mistake about it.  And yours _isn't_ there!"



> [p120] [eeyore] "A little Consideration, a little Thought for Others, makes all
> the difference."



> [p92] "It is hard to be brave," said Piglet, sniffing slightly, "when
> you're only a Very Small Animal."
> Rabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said:
> "It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in
> the adventure before us."
> Piglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful that he forgot to be
> frightened any more [...] he could hardly sit still, he was so 
> to begin being useful at once.



> [p129] [piglet] "There's Pooh," he thought to himself.  "Pooh hasn't much
> Brain, but he never comes to any harm.  He does silly things and they
> turn out right."
