Classic. Short interviews with people about their work and their
life.  The Protestant Work Ethic really comes through.


> [p366] [Conrad Swibel, meter reader] I've been bit once already by a
> German shepherd.  And that was something. It was really scary.  It
> was an outside meter the woman had.  I read the gas meter and was
> walking back out and heard a woman yell.  I turned around and this
> German shepherd was comin' at me.  The first thing I thought was that
> he might go for my throat, like the movies.  So I crouched down and
> gave him my arm instead of my neck.  He grabbed a hold of my arm, bit
> that, turned around.  My arm was kinda soft, so I thought I'd give
> him something harder.  So I gave him my hand.  A little more bone in
> that.  So he bit my hand. 



> I gave it to him so he wouldn't bit my throat.  I didn't want him
> to grab hold of my face.  He turned around again and by that
> time--they usually give you a three-cell flashlight, a pretty big
> one--I had that out and caught him right in the mouth.  And he took
> the flashlight away from me.  I jammed it in his mouth and he just
> ripped it away.  I jumped a six-foot fence tryin' to get away from
> him, 'cause then I had my senses back.  It was maybe in five seconds
> this all happened.



> Terkel: ``Were you hurt?''



> No. Just a hole right here in my arm.  (Indicates a livid scar.)...



> Usually they'll say, ``Don't hit the dog.'' If it's bad enough, I
> usually hit him in the head with the flashlight, to knock it away.
> Then they'll say, ``Why did you hit it?  The dog's not gonna bite
> you.'' I say, ``It's jumping on me, it's scratching me.'' And she
> says, ``All it's doing is scratching you?'' It's weird.  It's not
> biting me, it's scratching me.  (Laughs.) So that's ok.



> Terkel: ``When nobody's looking...?''



> You kick him down the stairs usually.  (Laughs.) Usually the dog
> will follow you down the stairs and back up.  That'll give you a good
> chance, 'cause the dog'll try to pass you.  So you would kick him
> down the stairs. (Laughs.)  Even if he just follows you down the
> stairs you try to get him for the one you missed a couple of houses
> back.  Many people will report you if you abuse a dog.  But what about
> me?
> ...



> [p370] If you see a nice lady sitting there in a two-piece bathing
> suit--if you work it right and they'll be laying on their stomach in
> the sun and they'll have their top strap undone--if you go there and
> you scare 'em good enough, they'll jump up.  To scare 'em where they
> jump up and you would be able to see them better, this takes time and
> it gives you something to do.  It adds excitement to your day.  If
> you startle 'em they'll say, ``You could've said something earlier,
> rather than just jumping up behind me yelling, `Gas man'!'' You have
> to make excitement for yourself.



> Jesusita Navarro, housewife, [p403] How are you going to get people off
> welfare if they're constantly being pushed down?  If they're
> constantly feeling they're not good for anything?  People say, I'm
> down, I'll stay down.  And this goas on generation to generation to
> generation.  Their daughter and their daughter and their daughter.
> So how do you break this up?  These kids don't ask to be born--these
> kids are gonna grow up and give their lives one day.  There will
> always be another Vietnam.



> There will always be war.  There always has been.  There way the
> world is run, yes, there will always be war.  Why?  I really don't
> know.  Nobody has ever told me.  I was so busy handling my own
> affairs and taking care of my children and trying to make my own
> money and calling up welfare when my checks are late or something has
> been stolen.  All i know is what's going on here.  I'm an intelligent
> woman up to a certain point, and after that...I wish I knew.  I guess
> the big shots decided the war.  I don't question it, because I've
> been busy fighting my own little war for so long.



> Elmer Ruiz, gravedigger, [p660] They ask me if it is true when we bury
> somebody we dig 'em out in four, five years and replace 'em with
> another one.  I tell 'em no.  When these people is buried, he's
> buried here for life.
