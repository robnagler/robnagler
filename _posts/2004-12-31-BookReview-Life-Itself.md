> [p8] Individual celss of Dictyostelium roam the forest floor as
> free-living amoebas, but if the food supplies turn scarce, they
> congregate in huge masses and assemble themselves by the thousands
> into a much larger multicelled organism that looks and acts like a
> slug.  The slug creeps about for a while, then settles down and
> metamorphoses into something that looks like a fungus.  The blob of
> celss sprouts a thin stalk that projects upward perhaps a quarter of
> an inch.  Then other cells of the slug climb up the stalk and organize
> themselves into a ball balanced on top.  The outer celss harden into a
> shell; the inner celss shrivel into dustlike spores.  Eventually the
> shell cracks open and the spores are scattered to the wind.  Spores
> that land in wet places change inot amoebas and slither off to begin
> the cycle anew.



> [p13] Millions of [killer cells] roam the body, searching for other
> cells that have turned cancerous.  Once the killer cell finds its
> prey, it presses close and exudes a substance that kills the cell.
> This newly emerging understanding of natural killer cells,
> incidentally, is leading to new ideas on the prevention, cause , and
> cure of cancer.  Some researchers suspect cells frequently turn
> cancerous but are usually killed before they can proliferate into
> tumors. One reason tumors arise, then, may be defective killer cells,
> so some researchers are looking for ways to cure cancer by boosting
> the number of killer cells in the body.



> [p15] The phenomenon, sometimes called apoptosis, is in fact the way
> "natural killer cells" destroy cells that have turned cancerous.  It
> also plays a key role in embryonic development, performing the
> cellular equivalent of removing the scaffolding after construction is
> complete.  For example, during the fifth week of human embryonic life,
> the hands are flat paddles with no distinct fingers.



> [p16] The main thing cultured cells need is to be bathed in a fluid
> that contains some food -- mainly sugar, mineral salts, some vitamins,
> and some amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.  The
> fluid should both suply oxygen and take up the waste product carbon
> dioxide.



> [p16] Periodically the cells cease their travels, let go of all
> attachments to the surface, pull themselves into a round ball, and
> undergo perhaps the most dramatic of life's many astonishing phenomena
> -- cell division.  The cell breaks down som of its old internal
> structures, recycling the components to assemble new ones.  The cells'
> genetic endowment, made fo the chemical DNA, is copied into a
> duplicate set of genes.



> [p16] Many cells living in culture remember their old lives as parts
> of tissues in larger organisms.  Skin cells, for example, will will
> multiply until they form a sheet covering the bottom of their
> container, just as they used to make skin in their native habitat.
> Under certain conditions, the layer of skin cells will even develop
> into proper, multilayered skin -- human tissue assembling itself right
> in a dish.



> [p20] What happens is that the water outside the cells freezes before
> the water inside the cells.  This is because all the molecules
> normally present inside the cell lower the freezing point.  THe
> antifreeze keeps the water crystals outside the cell from becoming
> large enough to pierce the cell membranes.  As the outside water
> slowly crystallizes, however, the liquid water inside the cell is
> drawn out, difussing through pores in the cell's membrane and joining
> hte ice forming outseide the cell.  The cell shrinks, literally
> deflated by the loss of water.  If conditions are right, virtually all
> fo the water will have left the cell before the inside becomes cold
> enough that it would freeze water into crystals big enough to rupture
> internal membranes.



> [p24] Molecules of a given shpae and composition possess the power not
> only to link themselves into larger structures but to act on entirely
> different molecules, causing them to break apart in specific ways or
> to combine with sill other molecules in predictible ways.  The
> molecules that act upon other molecules, for example, are
> intracellular mechanics called enzymes.



> [p25] Mono's book was deeply disturbing to many because it asserted
> that no event in the life of a cell or, indeed, in the life of a whole
> human body, was the result of any supernatural guiding hand.



> [p30] But unlike glassware, most membranes completely seal the
> volume within them, allowing passage in or out only to certain specific
> molecules and then usually only the molecules that pass inspection by
> gatekeeper molecules embedded in the membrane.  The gatekeepers --
> called receptors or, sometimes, docking proteins -- peer out fo the
> membrane at the passing scene, waiting for just the right molecule to
> come along.  Then the receptor grabs the molecule.  Or you can think
> of the receptor as a docking site shaped so that only one particular
> kind of molecule can come along and fit into the receptor.  Once the
> two molecules embrace, drawn together by physical forces between one
> another, the receptor changes its own shape.  THe part of it that
> sticks inside the organelle then triggers some specific process. In
> some receptors, this process leads to the arriving molecule being
> taken isnside the organelle, or even into the cell as a whole because
> similar receptors exist on the outer surfaces of cells.  In other
> case, the molecule stays outside but simply triggers some process
> within the organelle or cell.



> [p31] Receptors are ofthen thought of as locks that can be opened only
> by the right keys.



> [p31] Organelles also send out substances to be taken up by some other
> organelle in the cell.  Most of this shipping is containerized; that
> is, the molecules are transported inside tiny bubbles of membrane,
> called besicles.  This process, too is mediated by receptors.



> [p34] Szent-Gyorgyi didn't know it at the time, but the hot-water
> extract contained one of the most crucial kinds of molecules in cells,
> adenosine triphosphate, or ATP.  It is a molecule manufactured in all
> cells that, somewhat like a battery, stores and releases energy to
> power most of life's activities.



> [p38] As it happens, kinesin moves freight only in the outbound
> direction -- from the nerve cell's main body through the axon to a
> distant structure called the synapse, which is where one nerve cell
> r3elays its segnal to another.  (Inside the vesicles are signal
> molecules, called neruotransmitters, that one nerve will release to
> act upon antoehr.)  Different vesicles, however, also move inbound
> along the same microtubules, propelled by different motor molecules.



> [p39] Dynein [outbound motors] had been known for years for creating a
> special kind of motion inside the hairlike projections, called cilia
> and flagella, that many cells possess.



> [p41] As some cell biologists imagine it, the process probably works
> like an imaginary postal system in which letters have addresses but
> are dispatched randomly in trucks and planes.  At every post office,
> somebody checks the address.  If the parcell happens to be at its
> destination, it is accepted.  IF not, it is tossed back and sent
> elsewhere.



> Once the vesicle arrives at its intended destination, its membrane
> fuses with that of the organelle and the carge is automatically dumped
> inside.  Vesicle fusion, of course, must itself be a strictly
> controlled process, for if it were not, vesicles throught the cell
> would fuse into one big vesicle, destroying the orderliness of the
> compartmentalization.



> [p44] This creature was a macrophage, one of the free-roaming types of
> white (actually colorless) blood cells that functions as part of the
> immune system and one off the most fascinating types of cells in the
> human body.  Macrophages inhabit the bloodstream but can also slip
> through tiny pores in the walls of blood vessels and wander in other
> tissues of the body.  Macrophage is Latin for "big eater."  As it
> happens, macrophages maintain the ancient ways of their protozoan
> ancestors by creeping about their habitat and feeding on other
> organisms.  In the human body macrophages swallow invading bacteria
> and viruses whole the way an amoeba does, by oozing around them and
> engulfing them.  Macrophages are also the boy's garbage collectors,
> and sometimes even its undertakers, eating aging or fatally damaged
> cells of other types.



> [p48] Myosin pulls on a different kind of filament called actin.  It
> is now well established that in muscle cells both actin molecules and
> myosin molecules braided into separate filaments that lie parallel to
> one another.  Myosin can pull because it has little projecting "heads"
> that act like kinesin, grabbing the actin and pulling on it.
