Carol Rovelli studies quantum gravity and is a proponent of
[loop theory](http://n99.us/juf). The Order of Time describes
Rovelli's view of his work. I enjoyed it, and learned a bit about
quantum physics.

There is one equation in the book, which is key: entropy never
decreases. There are other equations in footnotes, which interested me
at times and are too complex for me in general. You don't need to read
them, but you do need to understand that disorder increases, and
that's what matters. For adherents of loop theory, time does not exist
at the microscopic level.

Time does exist in the world we can perceive, and Rovelli explains why
it does. It's interesting. Music is not a collection of tones, but a
relationship of those notes. Time exists as a blur between the notes,
but that's what we hear. The blur between microscopic states is how we
interact with the world.

Rovelli ties in a lot of biographical details to the subject of the
book. Boltzman had bipolar disorder, and he "saw atoms and molecules
frenziedly moving." A month before Einstein dies, he writes, "the
distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly
persistent illusion." He was writing to console the sister of Michele
Besso, Einstein's best friend, who has just died. Interesting, but
there are too many of these details for my liking.

The "fight is still raging" over whether Rovelli's view of the quantum
gravity is more probable than other theories, which he doesn't
discuss in any detail. That bothered me, but I probably wouldn't have
been able to absorb the details.

I learned some facts, which kind of put things in perspective. Planck
time is 10<sup>-44</sup> seconds, which is the smallest unit of
time. Planck length is around 10<sup>-33</sup>, which is the smallest
length. Kind of interesting.

Rovelli mixes in lots of culture. He seems to be well-read and a fan
of the philosophy of science. He uses quotes from the ancient Greeks
and the Grateful Dead (below). Cute.

His writing is often over the top poetic. The sentences get too
long. He also worships idols. He notes (in a footnoote) that he tends
to single people out as being heroes of science, and that people have
complained about this, because scientific discoveries are the work of
many people. He does this over and over, which gets tiresome.

At then end equates time with suffering (a la Buddhism), and that
he'll be ready for death when it comes. That world view is a bit odd
to me, because it conflicts with his criticism that we think too much
about the future. It presumes death will be quick. If you die slowly
with chronic pain, somebody may be ready to kill themselves and others
may be seriously uncomfortable for a decade. Time plays a real factor
in how we die, too, and his position seems too trite.

>    according to the order of time.

> [k159] the whole of our physics, and science in general, is about
> how things develop "according to the order of time."

> [k171] Times are legion: a different one for every point in
> space. There is not one single time; there is a vast multitude of
> them.

> [k173] Einstein has given us the equations that describe how proper
> times develop _relative to each other_.

> [k182] Time has lost its first aspect or layer: its unity.

> [k232] Sadi's pamphlet finds its way into the hands of a
> fierce-eyed, austere Prussian professor called Rudolf Clausius. It
> is he who grasps the fundamental issue at stake, formulating a law
> that was destined to become famous: if nothing else around it
> changes, heat _cannot_ pass from a cold body to a hot one.

> [k236] This is the _only_ basic law of physics that distinguishes the
> past from the future.

> [k241] In the elementary equations of the world,13 the arrow of time
> appears _only_ where there is heat.

> [k247] The ball's slowing down and coming to rest are due to
> friction, and friction produces heat. Only where there is heat is
> there a distinction between past and future. Thoughts, for instance,
> unfold from the past to the future, not vice versa--and, in fact,
> thinking produces heat in our heads....

> [k258] Clausius's entropy, indicated by the letter S, is a
> measurable and calculable quantity that increases or remains the
> same but _never decreases_, in an isolated process.

> [k264] Forgive me for the equation--it's the only one in the

> refrain from including it in my book about time.

> [k291] The growth of entropy is nothing other than the ubiquitous
> and familiar natural increase of disorder.
>
> This is what Boltzmann understood.

> [k294] It was a brilliant intuition, and a correct one. But does it
> clarify the difference between past and future? It does not. It just
> shifts the question. The question now becomes: why, in one of the

> [k310] The notion of "particularity" is born only at the moment we

> precisely the quantity that counts _how many_ are the different
> configurations that our blurred vision does _not_ distinguish between.

> [k324] It's a conclusion that leaves us flabbergasted: is it really
> possible that a perception so vivid, basic, existential--my
> perception of the passage of time--depends on the fact that I cannot
> apprehend the world in all of its minute detail?

> [k360] For everything that moves, time passes more slowly[.]

> [k408] The notion of "the present" refers to things that are close
> to us, not to anything that is far away.

> [k411] It depends on the precision with which we determine time. If
> by nanoseconds, the present is defined only over a few meters; if by
> milliseconds, it is defined over thousands of kilometers.

> [k528] It is awkward to organize train timetables if each station
> marks time differently.

> [k535] It can hardly be pure coincidence that, before gaining a

> office, dealing specifically with patents relating to the
> synchronization of clocks at railway stations.

> [k553] So if nothing changes, if nothing moves, does time therefore
> cease to pass?
>
> Aristotle believed that it did.

> [k555] Time is the measure of change: if nothing changes, there is
> no time.

> [k585] It indicates time that is "absolute, true, and mathematical,"
> assumed by Newton to run _independently of things that change or
> things that move_.

> [k597] In a still celebrated, furious counterblast, Leibniz defended
> the traditional thesis according to which time is only the order of
> events, arguing that there is no such thing as an autonomous time.

> [k612] Aristotle was the first to discuss in depth and with acuity
> the meaning of "space," or "place," and to arrive at a precise
> definition: the place of a thing is what surrounds that thing.

> [k617] For Newton, between two things there may also be "empty
> space."

> [k619] Newton imagines that things are situated in a "space" that
> continues to exist, empty, even when divested of things.

> [k647] The synthesis between Aristotle's time and Newton's is the

> [k653] Physicists call "fields" the substances that, to the best of
> our knowledge, constitute the weave of the physical reality of the
> world. Sometimes they may be given exotic names: the fields "of
> Dirac" are the fabric of which tables and stars are made.

> [k655] But--here is the key point--there is also a "gravitational"
> field: it is the origin of the force of gravity, but it is also the
> texture that forms Newton's space and time, the fabric on which the
> rest of the world is drawn.

> [k666] But the field can also undulate, in what we call
> "gravitational waves."

> [k679] True and mathematical Newtonian time exists; it is a real

> spacetime in the diagram.

> [k691] Einstein writes the equations of the gravitational field in

> that this cannot be the last word on the nature of time and space,
> because of the existence of quantum mechanics.

> [k704] The discipline that studies these is called "quantum
> gravity," and this is my own field of research.

> [k707] My scientific life has been largely dedicated to contributing

> [k716] The three fundamental discoveries that quantum mechanics has
> led to are these: granularity, indeterminacy, and the relational

> the little that was left of our idea of time.

> [k724] Together, these determine the time to 10<sup>-44</sup>
> seconds[.]

> [k725] This is Planck time: at this extremely minuscule level,
> quantum effects on time become manifest.

> [k729] The "quantization" of time implies that almost all values of
> time _t do not exist_.

> [k732] In other words, a _minimum_ interval of time exists. Below
> this, the notion of time does not exist--even in its most basic
> meaning.

> [k735] The good Lord has not drawn the world with continuous lines:

> Georges Seurat.

> [k742] In the thirteenth century, the great philosopher Maimonides
> writes: "Time is composed of atoms, that is to say of many parts
> that cannot be further subdivided, on account of their short
> duration."

> [k747] The spatial sister of _Planck time_ is _Planck length_: the
> minimum limit below which the notion of length becomes
> meaningless. Planck length is around 10<sup>-33</sup> centimeters[.]

> [k758] Spacetime is a physical object like an electron. It, too,
> fluctuates. It, too, can be in a "superposition" of different
> configurations.

> [k767] Indeterminacy is resolved when a quantity interacts with
> something else.
>
> In the interaction, an electron materializes at a certain point. For

> detector, or collides with a photon--thus acquiring a concrete
> position.

> [k782] When it does, the durations are granular and determinate only
> for that something with which it interacts; they remain
> indeterminate for the rest of the universe.

> [k794] So, after all this, what is left of time?

> Let's enter the world without time.

> [k809] None of the pieces that time has lost (singularity,

> the fact that the world is a network of _events_.

> [k817] The fundamental equations do not include a time variable, but
> they do include variables that change in relation to each other.

> things, of entities. It simply doesn't work.
>
> [k843] What works instead is thinking about the world as a network

> [k874] Newton's mechanics, Maxwell's equations, quantum mechanics,

> [k880] It does not even form a four-dimensional geometry. It is a

> [k929] Change, what happens--this is not an illusion. What we have
> discovered is that it does not follow a global order.

NOTE: I find writing like this overly dramatic, and it is excessive in
this book. This is also an example of how he idolizes other scientists.

> [k1117] _Everything_ in the world becomes blurred when seen close up.

> [k1609] In the wake of Husserl, Martin Heidegger writes--as far as

> since he is interested in what being is for man (for "the entity
> that poses the problem of existence"), Heidegger ends up by
> identifying the internal consciousness of time as the horizon of
> being itself.

NOTE: Rovelli says Heidegger is obtuse, but I find Rovelli obtuse at
times. These sentences could be simplified. He also goes on about
philosphers thinking about time, which I'm not sure helps his argument
about the order of time.

NOTE: I found this 60 word sentence unnecessarily complex. I read and
reread and didn't gain any more understanding.

> [k1653] We long for timelessness, we endure the passing of time: we
> suffer time. Time is suffering.

NOTE: This is his particular view based on his particular fears. I
don't know that it is a good argument in a book about quantum time.

NOTE: Evolution doesn't exaggerate. Characteristics like this evolve,
because they have survival value.
