> [p25] When you work you are a flute through whose heart the
> whispering of the hours turns to music.



> [p28] And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is
> better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the
> temple and take alms of those who work with joy.



> For if you bake bread with indifference, you back a bitter bread
> that feeds but half man's hunger.



> [p33] Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul,
> and then walks grinning in the funeral.



> [p49] And if it is fear you would disple, the seat of that fear is
> in your heart and no in the hand of the feared.



> [p58] For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires,
> all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.



> [p60] You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts;



> And when you can nolonger dwell in the solitude of your heart you
> live in your lips, and sound is a diversion and a pastime.



> And in much of your talking, thinking is half murdered.
