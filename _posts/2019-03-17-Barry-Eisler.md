Barry Eisler writes spy books. I read a bunch of them, which are
listed here, because I don't have much to say about them except they
are a good distraction for me. I did write up two books 
[The God's Eye View](/2019/02/23/Gods-Eye-View.html) and
[Paris Is A Bitch](/2019/02/23/Paris-Is-A-Bitch.html).

Eisler self-publishes. He also bought back the rights to all his
books, cleaned up the titles, and republished them. I read those
versions. I respect that about him. He has an interesting pedigree:
Cornell law degree, CIA operative, tech lawyer, Matsushita lawyer, and
then a startup. He practices judo which figures into his novels.

His books are about assassins, but they always have a moral code of
some sort. They defend the underdog. They don't hurt women and
children. He obviously gets some tech advice so there are curious
devices in his books. (There are some errors in the way he writes
about tech, but few will notice.) Like many spy books, he hammers the
points home. I guess that's good in a way, but it can get annoying at
times. I just skip when it gets too pedantic. It's nice that he tries
to have political and moral themes.

What follows are the books where I highlighted some text. I must have
read them all, but I didn't want to bother tracking that down.

_Zero Sum (A John Rain Novel)_

> [k64] What makes humans special is our need to rationalize our actions,
> rather than just accept them.

_Graveyard of Memories [Kindle in Motion] (A John Rain Novel Book 8)_

> [k79] It's funny to consider how important things like that felt to me
> then. Proving people wrong. Fighting stupidity. Wanting formal
> recognition. It took me a long time to learn that proving people wrong is
> purposeless, fighting stupidity is futile, and formal recognition
> prevents people from underestimating you--and thereby from ceding to you
> surprise and other tactical advantages. I turned left under the elevated
> tracks just as a JR train went by overhead, its roar rattling shop
> windows and obliterating the din of the crowd.

> [k3990] "Well, the reasons are important, too." "Up to a point. But
> everyone believes his own reasons are good ones. In the end, it's the
> limits that separate men from monsters."

_Livia Lone (A Livia Lone Novel Book 1)_

> [k272] The last time Livia had seen Tyler, he had been one of her
> captors.

_Inside Out (Ben Treven Book 2)_

> [k155] "Let me get this straight," he said, deliberately speaking slowly
> and clearly so Clements and the rest of the Langley contingent assembled
> before him would understand exactly what Ulrich made of their collective
> mental acuity. "Ninety-two interrogation videotapes, and you're telling
> me they're just... missing?"

_Fault Line (Ben Treven Book 1)_

> [k9] In Silicon Valley, the eccentric inventor of a new encryption
> application is murdered in an apparent drug deal. In Istanbul, a cynical
> undercover operator receives a frantic call from his estranged brother, a
> patent lawyer who believes he is the next victim.

_The Night Trade (A Livia Lone Novel Book 2)_

> [k110] She'd read somewhere that if you walked up and said a person's
> full name three times, that person couldn't help but smile.

> [k312] You couldn't fairly blame a man for acting in accordance with his
> nature. You could only remember your own mistake so as not to repeat it
> next time.

> [k927] Or better yet, just lose your cell phone entirely. It's less
> convenient than having one, but it beats dying. I learned that from a
> friend of mine. Very smart man who's lived longer than most in a
> dangerous business in part because he eschews convenience in favor of
> security."
