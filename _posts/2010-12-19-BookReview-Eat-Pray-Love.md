By Elizabeth Gilbert, Penguin, February 1, 2007, B000PDYVVG

Elizabeth Gilbert was recently divorced when she wrote this book, and
so was I when I read it.  Her experiences help me understand what I
was going through.  It's also a fun for me to read about Italy, and
the food descriptions were awesome.  I used to have a wood burning
pizza oven in my kitchen so I really relate to her pizza experience.
I practice yoga so I connected to the the spiritual chapters as well
-- despite me being an atheist.  There are a lot of quotes here, and I
didn't include all that I found interesting.  It was a very enjoyable
read.


> [k244] And three, of course, is the number representing supreme
> balance, as anyone who has ever studied either the Holy Trinity or a
> simple barstool can plainly see.



> [k344] "Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You
> really need to be certain it's what you want before you commit."



> [k1280] Generally speaking, though, Americans have an inability to
> relax into sheer pleasure. Ours is an entertainment-seeking nation,
> but not necessarily a pleasure-seeking one. Americans spend billions
> to keep themselves amused with everything from porn to theme parks to
> wars, but that's not exactly the same thing as quiet enjoyment.



> [k1286] Americans don't really know how to do nothing.



> [k1308] But while the Italians have given me full permission to enjoy
> myself, I still can't quite let go. During my first few weeks in
> Italy, all my Protestant synapses were zinging in distress, looking
> for a task. I wanted to take on pleasure like a homework assignment,
> or a giant science fair project. I pondered such questions as, "How is
> pleasure most efficiently maximized?"



> [k1356] But never again use another person's body or emotions as a
> scratching post for your own unfulfilled yearnings.



> [k1551] I look at the Augusteum, and I think that perhaps my life has
> not actually been so chaotic, after all. It is merely this world that
> is chaotic, bringing changes to us all that nobody could have
> anticipated. The Augusteum warns me not to get attached to any
> obsolete ideas about who I am, what I represent, whom I belong to, or
> what function I may once have intended to serve. Yesterday I might
> have been a glorious monument to somebody, true enough--but tomorrow I
> could be a fireworks depository. Even in the Eternal City, says the
> silent Augusteum, one must always be prepared for riotous and endless
> waves of transformation.



> [k1621] Giovanni passed along the name of the place with such
> seriousness and intensity, I almost felt I was being inducted into a
> secret society. He pressed the address into the palm of my hand and
> said, in gravest confidence, "Please go to this pizzeria. Order the
> margherita pizza with double mozzarella. If you do not eat this pizza
> when you are in Naples, please lie to me later and tell me that you
> did."



> So Sofie and I have come to Pizzeria da Michele, and these pies
> we have just ordered--one for each of us--are making us lose our
> minds. I love my pizza so much, in fact, that I have come to believe
> in my delirium that my pizza might actually love me, in return.



> [k1630] You need to get there fairly early in the day because
> sometimes they run out of dough, which will break your heart. By 1:00
> PM, the streets outside the pizzeria have become jammed with
> Neapolitans trying to get into the place, shoving for access like
> they're trying to get space on a lifeboat. There's not a menu. They
> have only two varieties of pizza here--regular and extra cheese. None
> of this new age southern California olives-and-sun-dried-tomato
> wannabe pizza twaddle.



> [k2361] And the task at hand in Yoga is to find union--between mind
> and body, between the individual and her God, between our thoughts and
> the source of our thoughts, between teacher and student, and even
> between ourselves and our sometimes hard-to-bend neighbors. In the
> West, we've mainly come to know Yoga through its now-famous
> pretzel-like exercises for the body, but this is only Hatha Yoga, one
> limb of the philosophy. The ancients developed these physical
> stretches not for personal fitness,



> [k2373] The Yogic path is about disentangling the built-in glitches of
> the human condition, which I'm going to over-simply define here as the
> heartbreaking inability to sustain contentment.



> [k2707] "It doesn't serve you. Your ego's job isn't to serve you. Its
> only job is to keep itself in power. And right now, your ego's scared
> to death cuz it's about to get downsized.



> [k2894] "But I wish me and David could--"



> He cuts me off. "See, now
> that's your problem. You're wishin' too much, baby. You gotta stop
> wearing your wishbone where your backbone oughtta be."



> This line gives
> me the first laugh of the day.



> Then I ask Richard, "So how long will
> it be before all this grieving passes?"



> "You want an exact date?"



> "Yes."



> "Somethin' you can circle on your calendar?"



> "Yes."



> "Lemme
> tell you something, Groceries--you got some serious control issues."



> My rage at this statement consumes me like fire. _Control_issues?_ME?_
> I actually consider slapping Richard for this insult. And then, from
> right down inside the intensity of my offended outrage comes the
> truth.
> The immediate, obvious, laughable truth.



> He's totally
> right.



> The fire passes out of me, fast as it came.



> "You're totally
> right," I say.



> "I know I'm right, baby. Listen, you're a powerful
> woman and you're used to getting what you want out of life, and you
> didn't get what you wanted in your last few relationships and it's got
> you all jammed up. Your husband didn't behave the way you wanted him
> to and David didn't either. Life didn't go your way for once. And
> nothing pisses off a control freak more than life not goin' her way."



> [k2914] _"They_can't?_ Honey--Ray Charles could see your control
> issues!"



> "OK, I think I'm done with this conversation now, thank you."



> "You gotta learn how to let go, Groceries. Otherwise you're gonna make
> yourself sick. Never gonna have a good night's sleep again. You'll
> just toss and turn forever, beatin' on yourself for being such a
> fiasco in life. What's wrong with me? How come I screw up all my
> relationships? Why am I such a failure? Lemme guess--that's probably
> what you were up at all hours doin' to yourself again last night."



> "All right, Richard, that's enough," I say.



> "I don't want you walking
> around inside my head anymore."



> "Shut the door, then," says my big
> Texas Yogi.



> [k2938] This was New England, after all, and the word God tends to
> make Yankees nervous.



> [k3027] I met an old lady once, almost one hundred years old, and she
> told me, "There are only two questions that human beings have ever
> fought over, all through history. How much do you love me? And Who's
> in charge?" Everything else is somehow manageable.



> [k4347] Then he breaks free and laughs, asking, "Why they always look
> so serious in Yoga? You make serious face like this, you scare away
> good energy. To meditate, only you must smile. Smile with face, smile
> with mind, and good energy will come to you and clean away dirty
> energy.



> [k4856] She opened her eyes, grinned and said, "I can tell by your
> knees that you don't have much sex lately."



> I said, "Why? Because
> they're so close together?"



> She laughed. "No--it's the cartilage. Very
> dry. Hormones from sex lubricate the joints. How long since sex for
> you?"



> "About a year and a half."



> "You need a good man.  I will find one for you."



> [k4880] She says that people universally tend to think that happiness
> is a stroke of luck, something that will maybe descend upon you like
> fine weather if you're fortunate enough. But that's not how happiness
> works. Happiness is the consequence of personal effort. You fight for
> it, strive for it, insist upon it, and sometimes even travel around
> the world looking for it. You have to participate relentlessly in the
> manifestations of your own blessings. And once you have achieved a
> state of happiness, you must never become lax about maintaining it,
> you must make a mighty effort to keep swimming upward into that
> happiness forever, to stay afloat on top of it. If you don't, you will
> leak away your innate contentment.



> [k5607] Then she added in perfect English (and perfect Balinese
> logic), "To lose balance sometimes for love is part of living a
> balanced life."
