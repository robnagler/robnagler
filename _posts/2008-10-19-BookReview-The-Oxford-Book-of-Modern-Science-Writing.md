By Richard Dawkins, Oxford University Press, June 15, 2008, 978-0199216802

One of the most interesting collections I have read in a long time.
Richard Dawkins chose the pieces extremely well.  There's a theme of
evolution, but also trying to understand evolution in the context of
the unverse.  I can't think of a page in this book which I skipped
over or which bored me.

Technology Note: I read this book on the Amazon Kindle, an e-book
reader, my first experience with such a device.  I don't intend to
review the Kindle.  I like it.  There are two things that are relevant
to Via Rob.  The first is that my reviews can no longer include page
numbers, since the concept of a "page" does not exist on the Kindle.
Instead, I'm listing [kNNN] values in the text.  The NNN is a Kindle
Location, which is impossible for non-Kindle readers to convert to
page numbers.  I apologize, but frankly, the page numbers are not all
that useful to anybody but me anyway.

Second, I will be getting my reviews out more quickly.  Indeed, this
review is coming out ahead of about 10 books I have read since my last
review.  The Kindle allows me to highlight text and to write notes
digitally.  I no longer have to scan my selections from the books I
read nor do I have to decipher my handwriting from sticky notes to my
only marginally improved writing for you to decipher.

Now back to the review which is already in progress... The selections
Dawkins picked are listed below separate from the quotes.  This is a
"modal" review.  If you read a quote from the book, it's author is
identified in the previous selection heading.  If the quote is from
Dawkins himself, it begins with [Dawkins].

 The following is a very Popperian.  I have been reading quite a
bit of late mid-20th century philosophy lately, and this book touches
on Kuhn, Feyerabend, and Popper quite nicely.

 The following interesting quote about understanding naturaal
selection.  Individuals (and their offspring) survive, and natural
selection says nothing about species or other groupings abstracted by
man.

 The following quote about Quetelet is like physicists trying to
treat each trade as the error off the mean (or the
high/low/close). The mean in economics is meaningless.  Unless a
transaction takes place the stock/bond/entity has no value.

> [k3345] Garrett Hardin from THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS


 I didn't know who Garrett Hardin is, but I enjoyed this article.
I think about the tragedy of the commons, quite often.  It's good to
know who coined it.

 In the following, Hardin explains how evolution favors denial.
The more aware (educated?) we are, the more we fight against
individual survival.  The fact that society needs rules is nowhere to
be found in the theory of evolution.

> [k3458] Per Bak from HOW NATURE WORKS


 One of the many problems I struggle with is how to grow bivio.
While I'm learning to "let go" of control, that does not mean I want
to let go of our core values: testing (feedback, criticism) and code
(communication).  As organizations grow, they often have to let go of
both of these ideals.  They compartmentalize to avoid the N-squared
communication problem, and they cease to have the ability to accept
criticism (test new ideas).  Some people say that bivio's systems are
complex, but I don't think of them that way.  Rather, we are achieving
the ultimate software goal: reuse.  And, reuse implies complication,
not complexity.  It takes a great deal to understand our processes.
Large companies are basically self-organizating, and follow an
evolutationary path of growth.  This is what I found interesting about
this little quote: evolution is the law of large numbers.  Design is
about the law of more with less.  Later you'll read about "more is
different", or evolution's law, from John Wheeler.

 Another interesting insight: Quality in some way emerges from
quantity.  Design is just the opposite: quanity is tamed by quality.

 This is a succinct description of evolution versus design without

 I've come to learn that The Constitution is not time invariant.
The words used hundreds of years ago are not the same words we use
today.  Consider the word "man" then and now.  What I think Turing got
wrong is that a human's brain constantly rewires itself.  That code
and data are not independent in the brain is very important to the
reason our brains can solve problems very differently from the Von
Neumann computer.

 Interesting thought about injecting random behaviour into
computers.  This is what genetic algorithms and some other search
techniques use to attempt to slay data complexity.  I also find it
interesting that Turing thinks you hold the program in your head.  Is
this is an intelligent way to design software, or not?  For simple
programs, yes.  For large scale, highly-refactored systems, no.  It's
impossible.

 Alas, this next paragraph defined the blueprint for AI that we
were to use over the next 50 years -- and still going imho.  Sad that
we haven't progressed past this.  What we see here is a strong
argument for Kuhn's paradigm-puzzle approach to scientific advance.
It takes an imaginative thinking individual like Turing to set the
course of "normal" science.

> [k4274] Stephen Hawking from A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME


 I like Hawking's egitarian approach.  I do wonder about the use
of God here.  For one, it presupposes monotheism.  Two, it does not
solve the thoughts about sects, which are at the core of many
religious debates.  Three, it supports a world view that is at once
confirming and disaffirming.  Is that right or fair?  I mean by this,
is it important to validate this historical concept? Should we think
of ghosts in the fourth dimension, too?

 It does seem to be what he is saying, that is, math exists only

 Wheeler is assuming that computer programs are well understood by
their creators.  Unfortunately, that's not the case, unless one
applies testing, like evolution applies to individuals.

 I like the idea "it from bit".  The universe *is* information.
The popperian universe assumes everything is measurable, which the
real universe isn't, of course.  The Popperian approach does apply to
computers, where all possible information is predetermined. One of the
reasons the universe is not computable -- or even a small part of it
-- is that it all happens in parallel. This is much like a distibuted
computer system which is not computable either -- it is
non-deterministic and behaves like the n-body problem.

 Wheeler introduces more is different, which explains why I do
bOP. I do not know what we are creating by adding and augmenting bOP,
but I do know that bOP will be and is different than all those systems
which are considered "finished".  I contrast this to "less is more"
used often by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Gustave Flaubert's "God is
in the details".  Less is more is a great *design* principle, but the
universe or the earth or anything in nature is not designed; it's
qualities are created from quantity (see above).  "More is different"
is an evolutionary and life choice principle.  Travel to new places,
read books like this one, and create lots of "its" to get "more",
which will be useful to you.
