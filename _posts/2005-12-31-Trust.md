 The basic premise is that trust is valuable, because high-trust
societies function more efficiently.  While there is often trust in
families, trust doesn't develop spontaneously.  It's about cultural
history.  America is traditionally a high-trust society, because
although there's a lot of talk about individualism, we spend a lot of
time volunteering and helping each other.  Japan is another high-trust
society.  The book ends on an odd note, I thought, because it leaves
open the question of whether we can restore trust in the U.S.  I'm not
sure myself, but at least I understand a bit more about why trust is
so important to effective societies.

I had quite a few excerpts marked, but these are my two favorites:


> [p47] Spontaneous sociability is critical to economic life because
> virtually all economic activity is carried out by groups rather than
> individuals.  Before wealth can be created, human beings have to learn
> to work together, and if there is to be subsequent progress, new forms
> of organization have to be developed.



> [p154] In general, the more demanding the values of the community's
> ethical system are and the higher are the qualifications for entry
> into the community, the greater is the degree of solidarity and mutual
> trust among those on the inside.
