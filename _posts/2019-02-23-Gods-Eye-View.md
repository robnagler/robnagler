I like Barry Eisler's books. I've looked at his site and Twitter
feed. He seems like a good guy in general. Part of a self-publishing
community, which is cool.

This is not a John Rain book. I don't think the characters were as
compelling, but it was fun enough.

NOTE: He goes on a bit about this type of stuff. I dont like
