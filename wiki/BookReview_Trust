@h1 BookReview: Trust
@div.bib by Francis Fukuyama, Free Press, 8/1/1995, 0029109760
 The basic premise is that trust is valuable, because high-trust
societies function more efficiently.  While there is often trust in
families, trust doesn't develop spontaneously.  It's about cultural
history.  America is traditionally a high-trust society, because
although there's a lot of talk about individualism, we spend a lot of
time volunteering and helping each other.  Japan is another high-trust
society.  The book ends on an odd note, I thought, because it leaves
open the question of whether we can restore trust in the U.S.  I'm not
sure myself, but at least I understand a bit more about why trust is
so important to effective societies.

I had quite a few excerpts marked, but these are my two favorites:

@blockquote
[p47] Spontaneous sociability is critical to economic life because
virtually all economic activity is carried out by groups rather than
individuals.  Before wealth can be created, human beings have to learn
to work together, and if there is to be subsequent progress, new forms
of organization have to be developed.

@blockquote
[p154] In general, the more demanding the values of the community's
ethical system are and the higher are the qualifications for entry
into the community, the greater is the degree of solidarity and mutual
trust among those on the inside.
