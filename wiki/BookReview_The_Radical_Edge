@h1 BookReview: The Radical Edge: Stoke Your Business, Amp Your Life, and Change the World 
@div.bib by Steve Farber, Kaplan Business, April 1, 2006, 1419511319

Steve Farber is a good writer.  This companion to the
@a href=^BookReview_The_Radical_Leap The Radical Leap
is almost identical in style, and just as entertaining.  The
book is a mix of factual and fictional stories, and he does not let on
which is which.  This is good.  The point is that you have to Love
Your Customers to succeed in business, and, I believe, to be *happy*
in your work life.

I found the start of the book a bit slow, and a partly pedantic.  He
is not nearly as naive as he makes himself out to be.  At the same
time, it is a good device for the problem at hand, and it works well
towards the end.

[p72] "It was nothing formal, Steve. At first, he was my
customer. He'd come in here with little Theodore--sorry, Edg--and our
friendship just developed over the years. We did a lot of talking,
that's all. Do enough talking, for enough years, and you're bound to
not only learn from each other, but also help each other out along the
way. He was the real genius; I just kind of goosed him along." She
paused for a moment, obviously lost in reverie, and then let out a
deep, trembling sigh. "Don't ever let anyone tell you that customers
are just customers. If that'd been my attitude, I'd have missed out on
one of my life's greatest treasures: Billy 'Pops' Maritime and his
little boy, Edg."

@blockquote
I don't know if she'd meant to, but Agnes had baited the hook, tossed
it into the pond, and jerked the line with perfect finesse. Cam was
snagged. For him, merely mentioning the Maritime name made Agnes
ripple with credibility; the fact that she knew Pops so well made her
virtually irresistible. That's pretty much how I felt, too.

@blockquote
[p78] Well, baby," Agnes sighed, "contrary to what the oldschool
bureaucrats would have you think, business is a deeply personal
endeavor. Whether you intend to or not, you put your stamp on every
bit of work you do, and you leave an indelible impression on every
customer and colleague you touch.  Each one of those impressions
speaks volumes of truth about who you are.  Business is not a mask; it
doesn't hide your face.  It unveils it--wrinkles, moles, warts, and
all."

@blockquote
[p113] "The modern malady, Steve, is people living lives of quiet
desperation. The three of us here, and many others like us-the ones
who want to use their gifts to change the world for the better-prefer
to live lives of amplified exuberance. That's how we move mountains,
baby. Cam isn't ready to look deep enough into himself to find that
clear, inspiring voice. So, even though it's in there somewhere, he's
got nothing to amplify. Not yet, anyway."

@blockquote
[p129] "The only similarities we look for are intent and
conviction. We are interested in those who strive-and that's an
important word-to change a piece of their world for the better. We're
not interested in talkers; only practitioners. And there's one more
critical factor."
@/blockquote

@blockquote
"What's that?" I asked.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
"Let me put it this way: when we get together it feels much more like
a reunion than a work session. We love each other's company;
therefore, we only invite people whom we're pretty sure we're going to
love."
@/blockquote

@blockquote
"Well. . . then I'm honored, I guess. I'm a loveable guy, that's
true," I mugged. "But I don't know if I qualify as a practitioner."
@/blockquote

@blockquote
"We think you're underestimating yourself, but let me finish telling
you what we do here. Once a month we get together and compare notes
about what we're seeing in the world around us and what we're trying
to do in response to it."
