@h1 BookReview: The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition
@div.bib by Richard Dawkins, Oxford University Press, May 25, 2006, 978-0199291151
A book about neo-darwinism by the greatest neo-darwinist of
them all.  It gave me a much better understanding of evolution as
a general mechanism for incremental development while teaching me
the incredible significance of the law of large numbers.  I read
the book eagerly cover to cover.

[k120] The gene is the unit in the sense of replicator. The organism
is the unit in the sense of vehicle. Both are important. Neither
should be denigrated. They represent two completely distinct kinds of
unit and we shall be hopelessly confused unless we recognize the
distinction.
