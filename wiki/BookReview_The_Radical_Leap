@h1 BookReview: The Radical Leap
@div.bib by Steve Farber, Dearborn, 2005, 0-7931-8568-8

An excellent book on how to lead/manage/be.  The book is written in
a witty, detective novel-like style that gets its points across
through colorful characters.  Extreme Leadership is motivated
by love.  The LEAP means: Cultivate Love, Generate Energy, Inspire
Audacity, and Provide Proof.  You are looking for OS!M (Oh Shit!
Moments), which means you are about to do something audacious.  You
can't do new and creative things without OS!M.
