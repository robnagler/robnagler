@h1 BookReview: The Secrets of Consulting
@div.bib by Gerald Weinberg, Dorset House, 1985, 0-932633-01-3
 A short Gerry Weinberg book, which I find useful for the
three laws he presents:

@blockquote
[p5] The First Law of Consulting:
*In*spite*of*what*your*client*may*tell*you,*there's*always*a*problem.*
@/blockquote

@blockquote
The Second Law of Consulting:
*No*matter*how*it*looks*at*first,*it's*always*a*people*problem.*
@/blockquote

@blockquote
The Third Law of Consulting:
*Never*forget*they're*paying*you*by*the*hour,*not*by*the*solution.*
@/blockquote
