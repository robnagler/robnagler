@h1 BookReview: Sophie's World
@div.bib by Jostein Gaarder, The Berkley Publishing Group, 1996, 0-425-15225-1
 A novel about the history of philosophy.  What I liked most about
the book is that it connects the various philosophical periods to each
other.  The plot has many existential twists, which makes the book
fun reading.
