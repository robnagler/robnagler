@h1 BookReview: Mine Own Executioner
@div.bib by Nigel Balchin, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1946

Nigel Balchin wrote lots of books, including a business book "How
To Run a Bassoon Factory" under the pseudonym Mark Spade.  I really
enjoy his dry wit and flowing prose.

common sense this might appear to be a clear case of an error of
judgement?"

Garsten leant forward slightly. "To the plain man who uses his
common sense," he said silkily, "everything is *always* clear -- after
the event."
