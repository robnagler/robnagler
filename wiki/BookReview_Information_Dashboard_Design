@h1 BookReview: Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data
@div.bib by Stephen Few, O'Reilly Media, Inc., January 24, 2006, 978-0596100162

Stephen Few's book is like a practical guide to Edward Tufte with
particular respect paid to computer systems.  His examples elucidate
problems and techniques clearly.  One problem with the examples is
that he doesn't correct them, like Jakob Nielsen does in Prioritizing
Web Usability.  The examples (e.g. on p115) are negative only.  How
would Few make them better?  Few is a bit long-winded in parts, but
in general, he writes well and concisely and the book is a very easy,
pleasant read.
