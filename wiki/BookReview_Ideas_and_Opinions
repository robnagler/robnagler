@div.bib by Albert Einstein, Crown Publishers Inc., 1985, 0-517-55601-4
 Einstein was not only brilliant, he was a great man.
There are some great, and very readable essays in this book.

[p10] Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathesome
nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I
hate them!

independence of the individuals composing it as on their close social
cohesion.

[p57] Incidentally I'm only coming to Princeton to do research, not to
teach.  There is too much education altogether, especially in American
schools.  The only rational way of educating is to be an example -- if
one can't help it, a warning example.
