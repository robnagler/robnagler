@h1 BookReview: How to Be Alone: Essays 
@div.bib by Jonathan Franzen, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, April 1, 2010, B003GFIVNE

Jonathan Franzen is a great writer.  I read Freedom, and then I
read this book.  I tend not to review non-fiction (beats me as to
why), but since I'm writing about Franzen, I'll say that Freedom was a
great book.

Franzen's essays are fascinating and poignant, especially the one
about his family.  I also enjoyed his rants.  I skimmed the last half
of the book, because it didn't seem that the subsequent essays
contained new concepts.  I recommend the book overall, though.

PRIVACY, privacy, the new American obsession: espoused as the most
fundamental of rights, marketed as the most desirable of commodities,
and pronounced dead twice a week.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k664] OUR PRIVACY panic isn't merely exaggerated. It's founded on a
fallacy. Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy, in The Right to Privacy,
sum up the conventional wisdom of privacy advocates like this: "There
is less privacy than there used to be." The claim has been made or
implied so often, in so many books and editorials and talk-show dens,
that Americans, no matter how passive they are in their behavior, now
dutifully tell pollsters that they're very much worried about
privacy. From almost any historical perspective, however, the claim
seems bizarre.

@blockquote
In 1890, an American typically lived in a small town
under conditions of near-panoptical surveillance. Not only did his
every purchase "register," but it registered in the eyes and the
memory of shopkeepers who knew him, his parents, his wife, and his
children. He couldn't so much as walk to the post office without
having his movements tracked and analyzed by neighbors.
Probably he grew up sleeping in the same bed with his siblings and
possibly with his parents, too. Unless he was well off, his
transportation--a train, a horse, his own two feet--either was
communal or exposed him to the public eye.

@blockquote
In the suburbs and exurbs
where the typical American lives today, tiny nuclear families inhabit
enormous houses, in which each person has his or her own bedroom and,
sometimes, bathroom. Compared even with suburbs in the sixties and
seventies, when I was growing up, the contemporary condominium
development or gated community offers a striking degree of
anonymity. It's no longer the rule that you know your
neighbors. Communities increasingly tend to be virtual, the
participants either faceless or firmly in control of the face they
present. Transportation is largely private: the latest SUVs are the
size of living rooms and come with onboard telephones, CD players, and
TV screens;

windows of one of these high-riding I-see-you-but-you-can't-see-me
mobile PrivacyGuard(Runits, a person can be wearing pajamas or a
licorice bikini, for all anybody knows or cares. Maybe the government
intrudes on the family a little more than it did a hundred years ago
(social workers look in on the old and the poor, health officials
require inoculations, the police inquire about spousal battery), but
these intrusions don't begin to make up for the small-town snooping
they've replaced.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
The "right to be left alone"? Far from disappearing,
it's exploding. It's the _essence_ of modern American architecture,
landscape, transportation, communication, and mainstream political
philosophy. The real reason that Americans are apathetic about privacy
is so big as to be almost invisible: we're flat-out drowning in
privacy. What's threatened, then, isn't the private

What's threatened, then, isn't the
private sphere. It's the public sphere. Much has been made of the
discouraging effect that the Starr investigation may have on future
aspirants to public office (only zealots and zeros need apply), but
that's just half of it. The public world of Washington, because it's
public, belongs to everyone. We're all invited to participate with our
votes, our patriotism, our campaigning, and our opinions. The
collective weight of a population makes possible our faith in the
public world as something larger and more enduring and more dignified
than any messy individual can be in private. But, just as one sniper
in a church tower can keep the streets of an entire town empty, one
real gross-out scandal can undermine that faith. If privacy depends
upon an expectation of invisibility, the expectation of visibility is
what defines a public space. My "sense of privacy" functions to keep
the public out of the private _and_ to keep the private out of the
public.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k709] Reticence, meanwhile, has become an obsolete virtue. People now
readily name their diseases, rents, antidepressants. Sexual histories
get spilled on first dates, Birkenstocks and cutoffs infiltrate the
office on casual Fridays, telecom-muting puts the boardroom in the
bedroom, "softer" modern office design puts the bedroom in the
boardroom, salespeople unilaterally address customers by their first
name, waiters won't bring me food until I've established a personal
relationship with them, voice-mail machinery stresses the "I" in "I'm
sorry, but I don't understand what you dialed," and cyberenthusiasts,
in a particularly grotesque misnomer, designate as "public forums"
pieces of etched silicon with which a forum's unshaved "participant"
may communicate while sitting crosslegged in tangled sheets. The
networked world as a threat to privacy? It's the ugly spectacle ### of
a privacy triumphant.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
A genuine public space is a place where every
citizen is welcome to be present and where the purely private is
excluded or restricted.

@blockquote
[k754] All I really want from a sidewalk is that people see me and let
themselves be seen, but even this modest ideal is thwarted by
cell-phone users and their unwelcome privacy. They say things like
"Should we have couscous with that?" and "I'm on my way to
Blockbuster." They aren't breaking any law by broadcasting these
breakfast-nook conversations. There's no PublicityGuard that I can
buy, no expensive preserve of public life to which I can flee.

[k772] WHY BOTHER? (The Harper's Essay)
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k820] Otto Bentwood, if he existed in the nineties, would not break
down, because the world would no longer even bear on him. As an
unashamed elitist, an avatar of the printed word, and a genuinely
solitary man, he belongs to a species so endangered as to be all but
irrelevant in an age of electronic democracy. For centuries, ink in
the form of printed novels has fixed discrete, subjective individuals
within significant narratives. What Sophie and Otto were glimpsing, in
the vatic black mess on their bedroom wall, was the disintegration of
the very notion of a literary character. Small wonder they were
desperate. It was still the sixties, and they had no idea what had hit
them.

@blockquote
[k851] But the biggest surprise--the true measure of how little I'd
heeded my own warning in _The_Twenty-Seventh_City_ -- was the failure of
my culturally engaged novel to engage with the culture. I'd intended
to provoke; what I got instead was sixty reviews in a vacuum.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k856] How did it feel to be a local kid returning to St. Louis on a
fancy book tour? It felt obscurely disappointing. But I didn't say
this. I'd already realized that the money, the hype, the limo ride to
a _Vogue_ shoot weren't simply fringe benefits. They were the main
prize, the consolation for no longer mattering to a culture.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k866] The only mainstream American household I know well is the one I
grew up in, and I can report that my father, who was not a reader,
nevertheless had some acquaintance with James Baldwin and John
Cheever, because _Time_ magazine put them on its cover and _Time_, for my
father, was the ultimate cultural authority. In the last decade, the
magazine whose red border twice enclosed the face of James Joyce has
devoted covers to Scott Turow and Stephen King. These are honorable
writers; but no one doubts it was the size of their contracts that won
them covers. The dollar is now the yardstick of cultural authority,
and an organ like _Time_, which not long ago aspired to shape the
national taste, now serves mainly to reflect it.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k879] My second novel, _Strong_Motion_, was a long, complicated story
about a Midwestern family in a world of moral upheaval, and this time,
instead of sending my bombs in a Jiffy-Pak mailer of irony and
understatement, as I had with The _Twenty-Seventh_City_, I'd come out
throwing rhetorical Molotov cocktails. But the result was the same:
another report card with A's and B's from the reviewers who had
replaced the teachers whose approval, when I was younger, I had both
craved and taken no satisfaction from; decent money; and the silence
of irrelevance.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k892] There's never been much love lost between literature and the
marketplace. The consumer economy loves a product that sells at a
premium, wears out quickly or is susceptible to regular improvement,
and offers with each improvement some marginal gain in usefulness. To
an economy like this, news that stays news is not merely an inferior
product; it's an _antithetical_ product. A classic work of literature is
inexpensive, infinitely reusable, and, worst of all, unimprovable.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k898] In 1993 I saw signs of the consolidation everywhere. I saw it
in the swollen minivans and broad-beamed trucks that had replaced the
automobile as the suburban vehicle of choice--these Rangers and Land
Cruisers and Voyagers that were the true spoils of a war waged to keep
American gasoline cheaper than dirt, a war that had played like a
thousand-hour infomercial for high technology, a consumer's war
dispensed through commercial television. I saw leaf-blowers replacing
rakes. I saw CNN holding hostage the travelers in airport lounges and
the shoppers in supermarket checkout lines. I saw the 486 chip
replacing the 386 and being replaced in turn by the Pentium so that,
despite new economies of scale, the price of entry-level notebook
computers never fell below a thousand dollars. I saw Penn State win
the Blockbuster Bowl.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k919] IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, when Dickens and Darwin and Disraeli
all read one another's work, the novel was the preeminent medium of
social instruction. A new book by Thackeray or William Dean Howells
was anticipated with the kind of fever that a late-December film
release inspires today.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
The big, obvious reason for the decline of the
social novel is that modern technologies do a much better job of
social instruction. Television, radio, and photographs are vivid,
instantaneous media. Print journalism, too, in the wake of In Cold
Blood, has become a viable creative alternative to the novel. Because
they command large audiences, TV and magazines can afford to gather
vast quantities of information quickly.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k936] We live in a tyranny of the literal. The daily unfolding
stories of O. J. Simpson, Timothy McVeigh, and Bill Clinton have an
intense, iconic presence that relegates to a subordinate shadow-world
our own untelevised lives. In order to justify their claim on our
attention, the organs of mass culture and information are compelled to
offer something "new" on a daily, indeed hourly, basis. Although good
novelists don't deliberately seek out trends, many of them feel a
responsibility to pay attention to contemporary issues, and they now
confront a culture in which almost all the issues are burned out
almost all the time.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k943] None of this stops cultural commentators--notably Tom
Wolfe--from blaming novelists for their retreat from social
description. The most striking thing about Wolfe's 1989 manifesto for
the "New Social Novel," even more than his uncanny ignorance of the
many excellent socially engaged novels published between 1960 and
1989, was his failure to explain why his ideal New Social Novelist
should not be writing scripts for Hollywood. And so it's worth saying
one more time: Just as the camera drove a stake through the heart of
serious portraiture, television has killed the novel of social
reportage.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1028] I can't pretend the mainstream will listen to the news I have
to bring. I can't pretend I'm subverting anything, because any reader
capable of decoding my subversive messages does not need to hear them
(and the contemporary art scene is a constant reminder of how silly
things get when artists start preaching to the choir). I can't stomach
any kind of notion that serious fiction is _good_ for us, because I
don't believe that everything that's wrong with the world has a cure,
and even if I did, what business would I, who feel like the sick one,
have in offering it? It's hard to consider literature a medicine, in
any case, when reading it serves mainly to deepen your depressing
estrangement from the mainstream; sooner or later the therapeutically
minded reader will end up fingering reading itself as the sickness.

@blockquote
[k1096] Looking me in the eye, Heath said: "You are a socially
isolated individual who desperately wants to communicate with a
substantive imaginary world."
@/blockquote

@blockquote
I knew she was using the word "you" in
its impersonal sense. Nevertheless, I felt as if she were looking
straight into my soul. And the exhilaration I felt at her accidental
description of me, in unpoetic polysyllables, was my confirmation of
that description's truth. Simply to be recognized for what I was,
simply not to be misunderstood: these had revealed themselves,
suddenly, as reasons to write.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1141] For Heath, a defining feature of "substantive works of
fiction" is unpredictability. She arrived at this definition after
discovering that most of the hundreds of serious readers she
interviewed have had to deal, one way or another, with personal
unpredictability.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1148] In her interviews, Heath uncovered a "wide unanimity" among
serious readers that literature " 'makes me a better person.' " She
hastened to assure me that, rather than straightening them out in a
self-help way, "reading serious literature impinges on the embedded
circumstances in people's lives in such a way that they have to deal
with them. And, in so dealing, they come to see themselves as deeper
and more capable of handling their inability to have a totally
predictable life."
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1219] In Gaddis's first novel, The Recognitions (1955), a stand-in
for the author cries: "What is it they want from the man that they
didn't get from the work? What do they expect? What is there left when
he's done with his work, what's any artist but the dregs of his work,
the human shambles that follows it around?" Postwar novelists like
Gaddis and Pynchon and postwar artists like Robert Frank answered
these questions very differently than Norman Mailer and Andy Warhol
did. In 1954, before television had even supplanted radio as the
regnant medium, Gaddis recognized that no matter how attractively
subversive self-promotion may seem in the short run, the artist who's
really serious about resisting a culture of inauthentic mass-marketed
image must resist becoming an image himself, even at the price of
certain obscurity.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1230] Silence, however, is a useful statement only if someone,
somewhere, expects your voice to be loud. Silence in the 1990s seemed
only to guarantee that I would be alone. And eventually it dawned on
me that the despair I felt about the novel was less the result of my
obsolescence than of my isolation.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1275] What emerges as the belief that unifies us is not that a novel
can change anything but that it can preserve something.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1280] Above all, they are preserving a community of readers and
writers, and the way in which members of this community recognize each
other is that nothing in the world seems simple to them.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
Shirley
Heath uses the bland word "unpredictability" to describe this
conviction of complexity; Flannery O'Connor called it "mystery." In
_Desperate_Characters_, Fox captures it like this: "Ticking away inside
the carapace of ordinary life and its sketchy agreements was anarchy."
For me, the word that best describes the novelist's view of the world
is _tragic_. In Nietzsche's account of the "birth of tragedy," which
remains pretty much unbeatable as a theory of why people enjoy sad
narratives, an anarchic "Dionysian" insight into the darkness and
unpredictability of life is wedded to an "Apollonian" clarity and
beauty of form to produce an experience that's religious in its
intensity.
@/blockquote

@blockquote
[k1323] But how ridiculous the self-pity of the writer in the late
twentieth century can seem in light of, say, Herman Melville's
life. How familiar his life is: the first novel that makes his
reputation, the painful discovery of how little his vision appeals to
prevailing popular tastes, the growing sense of having no place in a
sentimental republic, the horrible money troubles, the abandonment by
his publisher, the disastrous commercial failure of his finest and
most ambitious work, the reputed mental illness (his melancholy, his
depression), and finally the retreat into writing purely for his own
satisfaction.
