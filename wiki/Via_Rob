I am a programmer.  Over the years, I've written a lot about
@a href=^Programming_is_Easy Programming
.  This site collects some of these works, and is the
repository for new articles.

My opinions about programming and other subjects change over time.
For example, my book
@a href=http://www.extremeperl.org Extreme Perl
 was my early thinking on how to devolve responsibility in a team.
The methodology parts are too structured, and are not consistent with
how I evolve software now.

@a href=^/my/page?search=evolution Evolution
 factors big in my current thinking about software.  This
wasn't always the case.  I was a big fan of the waterfall model in the
1980s until I saw people and relationships as the core issue.
Programming-in-the-large requires a
@a href=^/my/page?search=team+trust team of trust
.

Code evolves by integrating
@a href=^/my/page?search=feedback feedback
.  The more feedback, the better.
A team of trust is fearless and can accept any feedback thrown at it.
Team members are never fearless.  Only in a team do we create a bond
of trust that enables us to overcome our particular fears in any one
instance.

@a href=^/my/page?search=psychology Psychology
 figures centrally in my life and work.
I strive to understand how my psyche affects my
actions and reactions.  I visit a psychologist regularly to help me
integrate the feedback the real world throws at me.  I also rely on my
incredibly supportive family, friends, and
@a href=^http://www.bivio.biz/bp/Team work colleagues
.

My opinions are informed mostly by my reading.  You can find many
@a href=^/my/page?search=BookReview reviews of books I find interesting
 on this site.  I generally add a review a month.

Work is an extremely important part of my life.  I have had rapture of
the bits since I was nine.  I am a principal in several companies all
of which are serviced through
@a href=^http://www.bivio.biz bivio Software, Inc.
, which leverages and continuously evolves
@a href=^http://www.bivio.biz/hm/download-bOP a large open-source platform called bOP
.

In 2005 I started a non-profit called
@a href=^www.kidcommute.org KidCommute
 to encourage kids to ride bikes to school, which
operates a program called
@a href=^www.boltage.org Boltage
.  Boltage runs a network of devices called
@a href=^http://www.dero.com/products/zap ZAPs
,
which report the number of kids riding and walking
at a number of schools in the US and Canada.
I believe it's important to tend the common green.

I have not authored any patents nor do I intend to.  I am proud
to say that I ran the Swiss chapter for the League for Programming
Freedom in the 1980s.  It is less that I think patents are evil,
but they are a waste of time and energy.  My business strategy is
to work in a tightly integrated team that produces a constant
stream of great innovations.

This page will evolve over time.  It'll reflect my current thinking on
a variety of subjects, and serve as
a jumping off point
of what I think is relevant.  Alternatively, you can sign
up for the RSS feed for recent updates.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your feedback.

P.S. I believe, like many things, our society has a love/hate
relationship with simplicity.  You'll probably love/hate this
site for its extreme simplicity.  If you see no virtue in its
design, you should probably read some of
@a href=^/my/page?search=tufte Edward Tufte's books
.
